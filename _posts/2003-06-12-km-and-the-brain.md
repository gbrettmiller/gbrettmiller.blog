When we talk about brains, we talk about **neuroscience** as dealing with the _technology_ and **psychology/psychiatry** as dealing with the _processes_ of the brain.  
  
Many KM practitioners recognize, indeed advocate, the distinction of two perspectives on KM: **Object** and **Process**. Together they make up a **System** perspective. You can't really look at one without the other. You can't really **_function_** without both.  
  
As I'm sure you've deduced, I'm leading to an analogy:  

> Neuroscience Object / Technology Perspective  
> Psych Process Perspective

  
In other words, **KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IS THE NEUROSCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY/PSYCHIATRY OF AN ORGANIZATION**.
