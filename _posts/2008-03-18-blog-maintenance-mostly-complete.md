Back in January I started the process of [remodeling 29 Marble](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/01/blog-business/)s, and today I announce the completion of that remodeling (to the extent that any blog is ever really complete). A couple of things you will likely notice:

- 29 Marbles has moved from its home on [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) its own address at [http://autism.gbrettmiller.com](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com//), and I've switched from [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) to [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/). I did this for several reasons, but mostly I was [taking my own advice to "own my data"](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/who-owns-your-data-who-should-own-it).
- The feed for 29 Marbles is still [http://feeds.feedburner.com/29Marbles](http://feeds.feedburner.com/29Marbles), so you should not lose your subscription. (I think you may have received a feed "refresh" of the last few posts, but that should be OK.)
- The left hand column is for information related directly to 29 Marbles, such as the search function, feed subscription, and category lists.
- The right hand column includes feeds from and links to other autism related resources. Although I definitely have my own opinion about certain things, I also think it is important to see others' views. That's why I've included feeds to the [Autism Hub](http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/) and [Age of Autism](http://www.ageofautism.com/), along with links to blogs by parents and autistics from I expect that this side will continue to grow.

I hope you'll continue to read 29 Marbles and offer the great comments and discussions that arise from the very important topic of autism, what it means, and where we're going. See you on April 2.
