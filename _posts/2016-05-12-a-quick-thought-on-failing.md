Though no one sets out to fail, failure is an essential aspect of learning. You can't learn if you never fail.Â But it is important to remember that failure is but a means to an end - learning - and not an end in and of itself.

Failure should not be sought out, but when it happens you should squeeze it for all it's worth and learn what you can from it.
