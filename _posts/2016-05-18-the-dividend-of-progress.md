In the lead up to the last US Presidential election (2012) I wrote a post entitled [If the government were run like a business…](http://gbrettmiller.com/2012/09/27/if-the-government-were-run-like-a-business/) in which I asked (and somewhat answered with more questions):

> Most importantly, where do **citizens** fit into this model? ... It seems reasonable to say that citizens are the shareholders, but what is their investment? How do you measure return on that investment? Are all citizens/shareholders equal, or do some hold more “shares” than others?

With the presumptive Republican nominee being who he is, the question of government as a business has been on my mind again, although this time around I've got a bit more reading and thinking on the subject under my belt. I still don't have any answers, but I've got some more ideas I want to explore.

The title of this post was prompted by something that author [Rutger Bregman](https://twitter.com/rcbregman) said during an interview on the radio program [To The Best of Our Knowledge](http://ttbook.org/) - which, as [I mentioned yesterday](https://gbrettmiller.com/2016/05/16/rethinking-work/), includes several great stories about the future of work in the context of economics - specifically (and this is a paraphrase):

> **The universal basic income (UBI) is the dividend of progress**

This frames the citizen (we'll keep it at that for now) as a shareholder in the country. The citizen's investment is whatever they contribute to the progress of the country; be that in a regular job, as an investor, or maybe as a volunteer. The return  on that investment - to the country - is the progress that results from their investment; in some cases this will be the creation of a product, an increase in treasure, or a service that improves infrastructure. (These are, obviously, very basic and simplistic examples.)

![utopiaRealists](images/utopiarealists.jpg)Which, in the end, means that every shareholder - every citizen - receives a dividend, in this case as a Universal Basic Income. Yes, everyone. Including the wealthy. Of course, their contribution of treasure will increase as well, which will allow those contributing in non-financial ways (yes, those are valid, too!) to continue to make their own contributions to the success and progress of the country.

But but but.... That's <gasp> _**re dist ri bu tion**_ of wealth. Isn't it? It all depends on how you define wealth, I guess, and at what level you consider the distribution and redistribution. (fwiw, I am likely making a complete mess of Bregman's arguments and points, since I haven't yet read the book on which this interview was based, [Utopia for Realists: The Case for a Universal Basic Income, Open Borders, and a 15-Hour Workweek](http://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Realists-Universal-Borders-Workweek/dp/9082520303%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJWAGHMYTPK5725MQ%26tag%3Dwiscpublradi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D9082520303); it's on my Kindle waiting to be read.)

As it turns out I had been reading some stories and interviews about [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), the company behind [WordPress.com](https://www.wordpress.com), this past weekend as I attended [WordCamp STL 2016](https://2016.stlouis.wordcamp.org/) and came across this quote from [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) creator and Automattic CEO [Matt Mullenweg](https://ma.tt)

> We just look at the company as a whole. Maybe there’s a team of 4 people that throws off like $10 or $15 million in revenue. Or maybe there’s a team of 40 people that barely makes any money, or _loses_ $10 or $15 million. Things basically balance out between them.

So maybe it's not a perfect analogy / comparison, but I can't help thinking that Matt - and Rutger and many many others - just may be onto something here.
