An interesting article from [Amy Nelson](http://press.xtvworld.com/modules.php?name=Your_Account&op=userinfo&username=AmyNelson), [PressBooth - Autism Spectrum Conditions a Social Minority Group](http://press.xtvworld.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=6744) raises a very interesting concept for thought and discussion. I have to admit, I'm not quite sure what I think of it.  
  
Like all things surrounding autism, how an individual looks at this problem will depend a great deal on how that individual answers the question, "What is autism?" I'm going to have to think on this some more before posting any thoughts on it, but I figured I'd post this and see what others think.
