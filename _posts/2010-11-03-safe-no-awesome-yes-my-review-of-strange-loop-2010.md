When I [first learned about the Strange Loop developers conference](http://strangeloopstl.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/i-am-a-strange-loop/) here in St. Louis, I had a strong - you might say strange - urge to attend. Strange because I am not a software developer; it's been a long time since I've done any serious coding. What caught my eye was how conference organizer [Alex Miller](http://tech.puredanger.com/about) ([@puredanger](http://twitter.com/puredanger)) tied the ideas of one of my favorite books of recent years, Douglas Hofstadter's [I Am a Strange Loop](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465030793?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0465030793),![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0465030793) to [The Loop](http://visittheloop.com/) here in St. Louis and the idea of building an identity for St. Louis based developers.

More importantly, at least for me, it was not a conference focused on any one topic or language, but was like a survey course of the latest and greatest in many areas of development theory and practice. Here's a quick summary of some of the sessions I attended at Strange Loop 2010:

### **Semantic Web**

The first non-keynote talk I attended, Brian Sletten's ([@bsletten](http://twitter.com/bsletten)) talk [Semantic Web: Hot or Not?](http://strangeloop2010.com/talks/14459) looked at big-S Semantic Web, providing a bit of history about how it has failed to catch on in the past and why he thinks that its time has come. In case you are wondering, Brian voted for "hot".

Towards the end of the second day, Scott Davis ([@scottdavis99](http://twitter.com/scottdavis99)) presented [Hidden Web Services: Microformats and the Semantic Web](http://strangeloop2010.com/talks/14460), a look at what I would call small-s semantic web. Using some (not always cooperative) live examples along with his [presentation slides](http://strangeloop2010.com/talk/presentation_file/14460/Davis-MicroFormats.pdf), Scott showed [RDFa](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/) and [microformats](http://microformats.org/) in action.

Of all the talks, these two provided me the most practical information that I can make use of. As soon as I finish this review (and catch up on a couple of other things I need to blog), I will be diving into RDFa and microformats and seeing how I can put them to use on this blog and a couple of other sites with which I'm involved.

### **Complexity Theory**

[![](https://gbrettmiller.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/complexity_map1.png?w=300&h=217 "complexity_map")](http://strangeloop2010.com/talk/presentation_file/14461/Berglund-ComplexityTheory.pdf)Readers of this blog know that [complexity](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/tag/complexity/) is an idea that is never very far back in my thoughts, so I obviously made the time to attend Tim Berglund's ([@tlberglund](http://twitter.com/tlberglund)) talk [Complexity Theory and Software Development](http://strangeloop2010.com/talks/14461). He covered a lot of ground that I'm familiar with, but also gave me many new things to think about. And a couple of new ways to look at things.

Not taking anything away from any of the other presenters, Tim was one of the best presenters I had the pleasure of seeing. He was in one of the "small" rooms, but the quality of both the [content](http://strangeloop2010.com/talk/presentation_file/14461/Berglund-ComplexityTheory.pdf "Complexity Theory and Software Development (.pdf)") and the presentation would have made this talk well suited to the main room at the Pageant.

### **NoSQL**

When I saw the [NoSQL track](http://strangeloop2010.com/talk/by_track/944) on the Strange Loop schedule, I assumed that this was a specific database implementation, along the lines of mySQL. (I told you it's been a while....). Over the course of the two days, I came to understand the _concepts_ of NoSQL and how these concepts can be, and are, being used.

Eben Hewitt's ([@ebenhewitt](http://twitter.com/ebenhewitt)) talk [Adopting Apache Cassandra](http://strangeloop2010.com/talks/14471) provided me with a nice theoretical understanding that would serve me well through later talks, and Kevin Weil's ([@kevinweil](http://twitter.com/kevinweil)) provided some lessons in implementation in his talk [NoSQL at Twitter](http://strangeloop2010.com/talks/14446). The engineer in me really enjoyed Kevin's frank discussion of the challenges and solutions - some successful and some not - as Twitter addressed the challenges presented by huge data sets.

### **Android**

Next to the semantic web discussions, Ted Neward's ([@tedneward](http://twitter.com/tedneward)) talk [Busy Java Developer's Guide to Android: Basics](http://strangeloop2010.com/talks/14448) provided me the most practical value. My Droid gives me a reason - and opportunity - to use Android as a platform to get back into some development (however small scale it may be), and this talk gave me enough to get started. A quick overview of the SDK, some talk about the NDK, and then some runthroughs of ideas were great. Ted also had a wealth of knowledge which he freely shared during the extended Q&A that the session eventually turned into.

[![](https://gbrettmiller.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/square-3d-logo1.png?w=300&h=300 "square-3d-logo1")](http://squareup.com)It's tough to say which talk was my favorite, but if you pushed me to choose I would have to go with [Android Squared](http://strangeloop2010.com/talks/14452) from Bob Lee ([@crazybob](http://twitter.com/crazybob)) and Eric Burke ([@burke\_eric](http://twitter.com/burke_eric)) from [Square](http://squareup.com).  The talk focused on the engineering and software challenges related to using the Square in the mic port of an Android phone, including some detailed waveform and signal analysis and some tricks to deal with the wide variety of Android implementations out there. (It didn't hurt that they handed out some hardware at the end of their talk.)

Bob and Eric took turns talking about specific aspects of the challenges and the solutions. Like Kevin Weil, they held no punches in terms of talking about successes and failures along the way. They not only showed the final product, but provided some great insights into the process of figuring things out.

### ...

There are a couple of talks I attended but haven't mentioned, and then their are the keynotes and the panel discussions that were worth the price of admission (a low $190) all on their own. I'll try to get back to those, and maybe even the above talks, in more detail over the coming weeks.

### Summary (of my already too long summary)

At the top of Alex Miller's favorites list on Twitter is this tweet from Jeff Atwood ([@codinghorror](http://twitter.com/codinghorror)):

> "it's better to be safe than sorry" is such crap. You know what's better than being safe? Being AWESOME.

Alex most definitely didn't take a "safe" path when he put together Strange Loop. The venue was spread across three venues, including a club typically used for concerts, the hotel next door, and a couple of rooms from the Regional Arts Commission across the street. Some of the rooms got overcrowded, and there was a general dissatisfaction with the wi-fi availability. And then there is the cross-discipline (cross-language?) nature of the conference, which may not have provided the depth that some wanted but made up for it with breadth.

I can't speak for Alex and whether or not he is sorry about any of it, but I can say that he - and his cadre of assistants and volunteers - definitely hit awesome.

I'm already looking forward to next year.
