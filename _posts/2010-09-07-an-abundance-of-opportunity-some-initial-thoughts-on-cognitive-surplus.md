[![Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age](images/7614793.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7614793-cognitive-surplus)[Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7614793-cognitive-surplus) by [Clay Shirky](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/442126.Clay_Shirky)

My rating: [5 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/116474156)

In his new book, [Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594202532?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594202532)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1594202532), Clay Shirky covers some of the same ground as several other authors I've read this year. But even though some of the starting material may be the same - such as the Israeli day care story - Shirky tells a very different story, with a very different moral and outcome than those other books. (In case you're wondering, the two that come immediately to mind are Dan Pink's [Drive](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/my-full-review-of-dan-pinks-drive/) and Seth Godin's [Linchpin](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/seth-godin-wants-you-to-become-a-linchpin/).)

The upshot of the book is that in the last half of twentieth century people found themselves, in general, with a higher level of education and a larger amount of free time than at most any other time in history, while at the same time "accidents" of technology and policy created an environment of increased social isolation (think interstates, suburbs, and TV). On top of this physical isolation, there was technological isolation; the means simply did not exist for individuals to easily share their knowledge or their interests, and the ability to organize large groups around an interest was reserved for the well financed. This was the purview of the "professionals".

As a result, we - especially in the US - became a nation of consumers. Even as the technology has developed over the past decade or so to allow for broad sharing and easy organizing, Shirky says, we are only now coming to understand the implications and actually be ready to take advantage of the opportunities this technology presents. We are only now coming to appreciate what the "amateurs" can bring.

And this, in the end, is the point of the book: We have an abundance of opportunities available to us as a result of the technologies of social media (and all that entails), and it is our responsibility to take advantage of those opportunities.

A lot of thoughts rattling around my brain about this great book, more to come. In the mean time, check out Shirky talking about his ideas in this [TEDx talk](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/the-collaborative-nature-of-true-competition/).
