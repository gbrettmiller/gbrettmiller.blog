One of the dangers of new technologies/trends is the tendency for people to just use it because it is there. The world of blogs is no different. While personal blogs can get away with a bit of frivolity and not work to any real purpose, business blogs need to look at things just a little bit differently.  
  
On that is note is [**When A Business Shouldn't Blog**](http://www.businessblogconsulting.com/2005/08/when_a_business.html) from [Business Blog Consulting](http://www.businessblogconsulting.com) with a nice, short summary of some do's and don'ts (or, more accurately, why's and why not's). I've been looking at how blogs could help my wife's personal training practice, and this provided a much needed sanity check.
