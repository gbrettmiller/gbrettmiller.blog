Putting away the groceries last night, I happened to glance at the ingredients label on a jar of mayonnaise as I was putting it into the refrigerator. One ingredient jumped out: **calcium disodium EDTA (use to protect quality)**.  
  
Until a couple of weeks ago, this probably would have meant absolutely nothing to me. However, that chemical name was still fresh in my mind from recent discussions of autopsy results from the death of a child ([Abubakar Tariq Nadama](http://www.google.com/search?q=Abubakar+Tariq+Nadama)) during chelation. Apparently, Disodium EDTA was mistakenly used instead of, you guessed it, [Calcium Disodium EDTA](http://www.google.com/search?q=Calcium+Disodium+EDTA).  
  
Not sure what this means (probably nothing), it just seemed that this weird connection was worth mentioning.
