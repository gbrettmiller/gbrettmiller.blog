Chandler's mom writes [the following](http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/05/letting-go-of-chandler.html) about letting go of our kids:

> Our instinct as parents is to hold on tight and protect them from the harsh world and tell them where to go and what choices to make because we know better than they do. But if we are to serve them we have to let go of them just a little bit at a time as they begin to master their own lives, occasionally stepping back in when they are having trouble navigating (done with most frequency between the ages of 14 and 16).

Of course, for those of us who are parents of autistic children, the idea of letting go takes on a whole new meaning.
