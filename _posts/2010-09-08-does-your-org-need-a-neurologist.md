When addressing the idea of tacit knowledge in respect to knowledge management, most descriptions focus on the tacit knowledge **IN** organizations – that is, the tacit knowledge of the individual members of the organization – and how to capture and share that tacit knowledge. While I believe it is important to understand this tacit knowledge, I’ve always been more attracted to an understanding of the tacit knowledge **OF** an organization, what it is the organization as a whole ‘knows.’

As with individuals, organizations operate based on the tacit knowledge they possess and their ability to act on that knowledge when needed. In the human brain it is the connections between neurons – and the ability of the brain to reorganize those connections to meet the situation – that makes up the intelligence and tacit knowledge of the individual. In organizations, it is the connections between people. (see this [post of mine from 2006](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2006/the-tacit-knowledge-of-not-in-organizations) for a bit more on this.)

Many years ago, in one of my first ever blog posts, I wrote that "KM is the neuroscience of an organization." After reading [Is Enterprise 2.0 the neuro-organization?](http://www.boostzone.fr/is-enterprise-2-0-the-neuro-organization-3/) a couple of days ago, and a brief discussion with Harold Jarche ([@hjarche](http://twitter.com/hjarche)), I was once again curious.

Here's a start. (_Definitions from Wikipedia)_

[Neurology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology): a medical specialty dealing with disorders of the nervous system.
