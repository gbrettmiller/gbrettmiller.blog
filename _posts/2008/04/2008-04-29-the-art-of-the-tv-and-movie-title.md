If you (or a friend) enjoy watching the titles on movies or TV shows even better than watching the show itself, check out [The Art of the Title Sequence](http://www.artofthetitle.com "The Art of the Title Sequence"). Mostly just a collection of some of the best title sequences (quality over quantity), but the authors do throw in a bit of analysis as well. (Personally, I could watch them all day!)
