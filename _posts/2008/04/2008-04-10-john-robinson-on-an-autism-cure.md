This is kind of a follow-up to [my most recent post](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/04/whose-decision-is-it/). In responding to [Some Asperger questions from the audience](http://jerobison.blogspot.com/2008/04/some-asperger-questions-from-audience.html), John Elder Robinson Robison - author of the book Look Me in the Eye and [a blog of the same name](http://jerobison.blogspot.com/ "Look Me in the Eye ") - takes on the cure question:

> _If there were ever a cure would you take it, or would you think it was like taking a piece away?_At age 50, I am comfortable the way I am and I would not want to take any pieces away. As a teenager, though, life was a lot harder and Iâ€™d have had a different answer if you asked me this at age 15. I guess we become more comfortable with ourselves as we get older and hopefully wiser.

If you've read the book, you know that Robinson's Robison's life was anything but easy. Interesting, no doubt. But not easy, especially in a time when pretty much all kids - autistic or not - were left to sink or swim in the world.

_(A side thought for a later post: Could the increased amount of time parents today spend with their kids, compared with previous generations, be a contributing factor to the increase in autism diagnoses?)_
