While writing [my most recent post](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/04/genetic-engineering-and-autism/ "29 Marbles - Genetic engineering and autism"), I found myself [back 2 1/2 years to something I wrote](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2005/08/seeking-out-the-genetic-roots-of-autism/ "29 Marbles - Seeking out the genetic roots of autism") on the subject of the genetic nature of autism. The following quote from the article I was discussing is quite likely the source of my opinion, expressed in [The genetic basis of ... everything (Or: Maybe we are all autistic)](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/04/the-genetic-basis-of-everything-or-maybe-were-all-autistic/ "29 Marbles - The genetic basis of ... everything"), that the "autism spectrum" isn't restricted to those with an autism diagnosis (emphasis is mine):

> Autism is not a “you have it or you don’t” disorder, Todd said. Instead, it is a highly inheritable **continuum of traits**, much like height or high blood pressure. **The cutoff** for being tall or short or having high or low blood pressure **is somewhat arbitrary, he said. So is the diagnosis of autism.** The measure of autism is usually the inability to cope in the real world, said NYU’s Hollander.
> 
> “**People can be different without having a pathology**,” Hollander said. “It’s only a disorder if it causes stress or interferes with function.”

Reminiscent of [a comment from Laurentius Rex](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/04/what-is-autism-2/#comment-235) on a recent post.

Something to consider.
