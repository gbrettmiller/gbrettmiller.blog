It has been way too long since I've updated the appearance and performance of this site, and it is time to do some remodeling. I intend to keep posting, so if you read the actual site instead of a feed, please excuse the mess.  
  
On the subject of feeds, I'm also going to convert over to a [feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/) feed: [http://feeds.feedburner.com/29Marbles](http://feeds.feedburner.com/29Marbles). I'll have both available for a while to give folks a chance to switch over (if they are interested enough to go to the trouble), and then in about a month kill the blogger feed.  
  
On the subject of blogger and remodeling, does anyone know of any good 3 column templates?
