I've had a strong interest in video games on a personal level for many years (see [this page](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/video-games-future-of-education-or-harmful-addiction "NSL:  Video games - Future of education or harmful addiction? ") for some of my thoughts). More recently, I've become interested on a professional level in the potential for games to be used to support learning and other 'serious' purposes - hence the name "[Serious Games](http://seriousgames.ning.com/ "The Serious Games Portal")".

I see the techniques and technologies of video games playing an increasing role in helping to close the [work literacy gap](http://www.workliteracy.com/work-literacy-gap "Work Literacy:  Work Literacy Gap"). This is especially true as games and systems become increasingly "network ready" and the games become more multi-player and social.

Commenting to a [story in the Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121426677949598525.html), the Educational Games Research blog writes in the post [PSP Mini-nets Show Small Group Potential](http://edugamesblog.wordpress.com/2008/06/27/psp-mini-nets-show-small-group-potential/):

> The possibilities of harnessing the mini-net features of the PSP are striking. Small groups could be set up with the PSP to tackle a project together in an educational game. Excluding other players from the groups would allow a room full of students working on PSPs to organize into teams working on objectives within the game.

This is obviously a very small-scale, artificial (ie, classroom) situation, but it does show the potential of "social" games to help teach, and to help learn.
