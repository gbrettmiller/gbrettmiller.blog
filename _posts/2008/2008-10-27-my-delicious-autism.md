Quite often as a I read stories and blogs about autism, I find something that I want to return to later or that I want to note with a short comment but don't have the time nor inclination to blog.  So I've been trying to use [Delicious](http://www.delicious.com), the social bookmarking site, to help me do that.  Because I thought that the people who subscribe to and read this blog might be interested in what I'm bookmarking, I used the Link Splicer feature in [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com) to include my bookmarks in my FeedBurner feed for this blog.  Which worked fine, except....

I had failed to take into account how this would impact my feed's presence on the [Autism Hub](http://www.autism-hub.co.uk)'s own feed.  Apparently,  because the Hub feed is set up as an aggregator and not RSS a simple link to the site I bookmarked - instead of a link that showed the bookmark link along with my comments - is what Hub subscribers saw.  (I must admit, I never click the links for my own posts in the Hub feed ;-)  So, I've disabled the Link Splicer feature to alleviate this problem.

If you are interested in my delicious autism feed, there are three ways you can see it:

1. I have added my delicious autism feed as a widget on the blog site, so you can see it there.
2. You can visit [my delicious autism tag](http://delicious.com/gbrettmiller/autism) page.
3. You can subscribe to the [my delicious autism RSS feed](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/gbrettmiller/autism), and get it in your feed reader of choice.

You may also be interested in the [complete set of autism tagged bookmarks](http://delicious.com/search?p=autism), too.
