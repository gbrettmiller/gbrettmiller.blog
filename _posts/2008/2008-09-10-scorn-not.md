It's been a busy week or so, and I am still pulling together a review of [The Speed of Dark](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/category/books/speed-of-dark-books/), but I jotted a note to myself to blog this last weekend following the Republican National Convention and all the furor surrounding Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and her newborn son with Down's Syndrome.

Over the weekend, and with the news about Gov. Palin still fresh and in rotation, my iPod mix shuffled itself to Sinead O'Connor's version of Phil Coulter's  "Scorn Not His Simplicity", written about his young son with Down's Syndrome.

\= = == === ===== See the child With the golden hair Yet eyes that show the emptiness inside Do we know Can we understand just how he feels Or have we really tried

See him now As he stands alone And watches children play a children's game Simple child He looks almost like the others Yet they know he's not the same

Scorn not his simplicity But rather try to love him all the more Scorn not his simplicity Oh no Oh no

See him stare Not recognizing the kind face That only yesterday he loved The loving face Of a mother who can't understand what she's been guilty of

How she cried, tears of happiness the day the doctor told her it's a boy Now she cries tears of helplessness and thinks of all the things he can't enjoy

Scorn not his simplicity But rather try to love him all the more Scorn not his simplicity Oh no Oh no

Only he knows how to face the future hopefully Surrounded by despair He won't ask for your pity or your sympathy But surely you should care

Scorn not his simplicity But rather try to love him all the more Scorn not his simplicity Oh no Oh no Oh no ===== === == = =

I first heard the song many years ago when O'Connor first released it, and if you are a parent of an autistic child hearing it for the first time you can imagine my reaction.   I'd love to hear yours.
