It is a good time to be a virtual musician, especially if your platform of choice comes from [Nintendo](http://www.nintendo.com/). This past weekend saw the release of versions of the popular [Guitar Hero](http://www.guitarhero.com/us/) and [Rock Band](http://www.rockband.com/) game franchises for the [Nintendo DS](http://www.nintendo.com/ds) and the [Nintendo Wii](http://www.nintendo.com/wii), respectively.

[Guitar Hero On Tour](http://www.guitarhero.com/ghot/us/#/home/) brings the guitar strumming fun to the DS. I had a chance to try it out over the weekend and it is, in the words of my niece, "freaking sweet". Like the console versions, GHOT has a custom guitar controller.

"But the DS doesn't use separate controllers," you say? Check this out:

That in combination with a pick-shaped stylus and the DS touch screen make for very cool game play. Check out the [official game site](http://www.guitarhero.com/ghot/us/#/home/) for all the details.

The Wii version of Rock Band is, I'm sure, quite similar to the [PlayStation 3](http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3) and [XBox 360](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/) versions in terms of music and playability. Since I already have Rock Band for PS3 (working my way through a "Hard" solo tour), I doubt if I'll get the Wii version, but I know my brother's kids are already hounding him for the Wii version.
