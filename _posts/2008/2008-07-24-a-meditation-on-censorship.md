The following meditation on censorship comes from [365 Tao](http://www.amazon.com/365-Tao-Meditations-Ming-dao-Deng/dp/0062502239/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1216829265&sr=1-1) (June 13). It's been on my mind lately, and Kristina Chew's recent post [The R Word and Not So Nice Language](http://www.autismvox.com/the-r-word/) has prompted me to share.

> Emperors uphold censorship, But extreme repression leads to extreme reaction. Individualists believe in freedom, But extreme expression leads to extreme reaction.

The challenge, of course, is learning how to live and act in between these two extremes, and how to deal with those who inhabit the extremes.
