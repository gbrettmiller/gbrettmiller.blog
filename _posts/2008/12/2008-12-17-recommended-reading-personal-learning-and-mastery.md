[Tony Karrer](http://www.blogger.com/profile/15408035995182843336) recently asked for recommendations of [books for learning professionals](http://www.elearninglearning.com/book) (see #38 of his [100 Conversation Topics](http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2008/12/100-conversation-topics.html).)  There are many good books in this category, but for the purposes of this conversation I have 4 recommendations.

- **[How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci: Seven Steps to Genius Every Day](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440508274?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0440508274)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0440508274)** by [Michael Gelb](http://www.michaelgelb.com/).
- **[Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452267560?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0452267560)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0452267560)** and  **[Way of Aikido, The: Life Lessons from an American Sensei](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452279720?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0452279720)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0452279720)** by [George Leonard](http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/bios/george-leonard.asp).
- **[The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743277465?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0743277465)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0743277465)** by [Josh Waitzkin](http://www.joshwaitzkin.com).

The authors of these books each come from a different perspective: Gelb looks at what made the greatest learner of all time the, um, greatest learner of all time; Leonard tells his own personal story of learning and mastery after finding [Aikido](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido) later in life; and Waitzkin distills the lessons he has learned from his early life and success in chess and [Tai Chi Chuan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi).  But they also have much in common.

All break down the process of learning.  All stress the importance of your environment and surroundings, and taking advantage of the opportunities offered you as well as those you make for yourself.  And even though they give some ideas on how to become a lifelong learner - for instance [Gelb's 7 da Vincian Principles](http://www.michaelgelb.com/ArticlesDefault.php?art=davinci_retrofitted_article) - they all let you know that learning is anything but a cookie-cutter process.

Learning is a unique and individual process that requires constant attention and refinement.  Something important for learning professionals to remember, so they don't fall into the rut of one-size-fits-all.
