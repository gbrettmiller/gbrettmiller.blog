I have a feeling that the question of [work/life balance](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/tag/balance/) is going to be a consistent theme here, I know it is in my life.

In this video, [Chris Brogan](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/about/) tells us of the [importance of both work AND play](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/the-importance-of-play-and-work/).  Even if you love your work, are passionate about it, and are giving it your all; even if when you think of free time you think of doing that work because it is still so much fun; you still need to take a break every now and then to recharge.  That's play.
