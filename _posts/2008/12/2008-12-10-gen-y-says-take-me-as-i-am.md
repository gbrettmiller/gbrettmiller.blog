I wrote my recent post [Take Me As I Am](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/take-me-as-i-am/) with a specific, and intentional, slant towards autism and autistic individuals.  However, the feelings expressed are not limited to those with autism, as any young teenage rebel can attest.

In [Generation Y in the Workplace Explained](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/guest-post-generation-y-in-the-workplace-explained/), guest poster [Teresa Wu](http://www.byteresawu.com/) gives a [Gen Y](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y) perspective on the sentiment.

> As Gen Y enters the professional world, we bring a whole new set of rules. We’re often criticized for our restless job-jumping or our sense of entitlement. The truth is, we might play the game differently, but that doesn’t mean we’re not every bit as bright, innovative, and hardworking. Here’s why.
> 
> - We crave personal development
> - We pursue unconventional paths
> - We value company culture
> - We’re not afraid to ask
> - We embrace transparency
> - We just want to do what we love

Like [David Gurteen](http://www.gurteen.com/), from whom [I learned of Teresa's post](http://www.gurteen.com/gurteen/gurteen.nsf/id/gen-yers-want), I crave these same things today but wonder if I did when I was a few (!!) years younger.
