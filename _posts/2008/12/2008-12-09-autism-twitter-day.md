It has taken me a while, but [I've finally joined Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/gbrettmiller).   The catalyst behind getting me to join at this time is an event being organized by [Bonnie Sayers](http://autismfamiily.blogspot.com/) called [Autism Twitter Day](http://autismfamily.tumblr.com/post/62546682/autism-twitter-day-tuesday-dec-16th-pacific), scheduled for Tuesday 16 December, a week from today.  Mark your calendars!  _(Thanks to Kev and his post [Autism Twitter Day](http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1718) for the heads up.)_

> 
> This is open to **twitter members**, specifically those who are members of the **autism community**, whether it be a parent, sibling or relative.  If you are on the spectrum you are welcome to take part.  Most of the prizes are geared to children and young adults with autism or asperger syndrome.
> 
> The hashtag to be used for autism twitter day is #ASD.  This means when you post a tweet that day which is on the topic of autism - positive autism awareness, please use the hashtag, either in front or at end of the tweet.  Open up a window at [www.summize.com](http://www.summize.com/) and input #ASD to follow along with the conversation at the specified times.  Most likely they will run longer than one hour.  Stay tuned here and to my blog for prize and panel info.  [http://autismfamiily.blogspot.com](http://autismfamiily.blogspot.com/)
> 
> We will be testing your knowledge on autism spectrum disorders, this is how the prizes will be awarded.  Here is an example of a quiz I have on my site

If you have any questions about autism, or if you've never heard of such a thing as "positive autism awareness" (yes it exists!), check this out.  I think you'll be surprised at what you learn.

See you there.
