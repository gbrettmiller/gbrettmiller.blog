...if you are looking for someone to help you get the word out about your innovation. At least, this is the message I get from a quick read of [Innovators are a bad choice for change](http://www.anecdote.com.au/archives/2008/06/innovators_are.html) from [Shawn](http://www.anecdote.com.au/bios.php#shawn) at the [Anecdote blog](http://www.anecdote.com.au).

> Dr Rogers persisted thinking, if only he could get one farmer to try it out and then they could influence everyone else. After a time he did find someone to try out the new corn, a hipster dude who wore Bermuda shorts and fancy sunglasses. He enjoyed a bumper crop but the other farmers were unimpressed. This maverick farmer derided their way of life, he was an outsider and there was no way they were going to adopt anything from a Bermuda short wearing weirdo.

The story Shawn is discussing comes from [Influencer: The Power to Change Anything](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=007148499X%26tag=anecdote-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/Influencer-Change-Anything-Kerry-Patterson/dp/007148499X%253FSubscriptionId=0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2), which has this to say in regards to the story:

> Rogers learned that the first people to latch onto a new idea are unlike the masses in many ways. He called these people _innovators_. They're the guys and gals in Bermuda shorts. They tend to be open to new ideas and smarter than average. But here's the important point. The key to getting the majority of any population to a adopt a vital behavior is to find out who these innovators are _and avoid them like the plague_. If they embrace your new ideas, it will surely die.

Though I hate to say it, this explains a lot. I don't know if I buy into it completely, but I think anyone who fits the description of "innovator" given above can probably recount more than one story like this from personal experience. Shawn goes on to say that the recommended approach is to approach "early adopters", but I must admit I'm not sure I understand the difference between an "early adopter" and "innovator" in this context.

I also can't help thinking of this in the context of Michele's recent question in [Developing Work Literacies: Who's the Target Audience?](http://www.workliteracy.com/developing-work-literacies-whos-the-target-audience) Regardless of whether you stake out your target as the workers themselves or the organization's leadership, it seems that you should maybe avoid targeting the people who already embrace the concepts of Work Literacy.
