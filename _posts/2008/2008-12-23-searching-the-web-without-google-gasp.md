The topic of search engines came up during a recent  [conversation with Tony Karrer](http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2008/12/100-conversation-topics.html).  I told him I use Google some ([Google News](http://news.google.com) is actually my browser start page), but that I've set the default in the Firefox search engine list to [GoodSearch](http://www.goodsearch.com).

"Why use something other than Google?", he asked. "When do you use GoodSearch, and when do you use Google?"

For very specific or obscure searches, I've found that Google works better (i.e., provides more relevant results).  But for everyday, general searches - and to support my general personal learning activities - GoodSearch is more than sufficient.  If I'm looking for a general article, a popular news story, or just trying to track something down, GoodSearch is where I start.  If I can't find what I'm looking for quickly, I'll jump over to Google.

This does maybe slow me down just a little bit in trying to find something online, but there is a benefit to using GoodSearch.  If you are not familiar with [GoodSearch](http://www.goodsearch.com), here are the basics:

> [![](images/gs-cause-120x60.gif "good search")](http://www.goodsearch.com)GoodSearch is a search engine which donates 50-percent of its revenue to the charities and schools designated by its users. It's a simple and compelling concept. You use GoodSearch exactly as you would any other search engine. Because it's powered by [Yahoo!](http://www.yahoo.com), you get proven search results. The money GoodSearch donates to your cause comes from its advertisers — the users and the organizations do not spend a dime!

Personally, I GoodSearch for [St. Louis Elite nfpc](http://www.stlouiselite.org/about/), the non-profit that supports my son's Trampoline and Tumbling team.  Chances are very good that a non-profit organization near-and-dear to your heart is set up with GoodSearch, too, so check them out and start putting all those web searches to work for a good cause.
