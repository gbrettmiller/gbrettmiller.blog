Just inside the entrance to the [Art of Living Building](http://stlouis.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2005/12/12/story7.html) in Downtown St. Louis is the following quote:

> A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreations.  He hardly knows which is which.  He simply pursues his vision of excellence thorugh whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing.  To himself, he always seems to be doing both.

This came to mind as I was reading Lilia's post [Mama’s day, PhD work and being grounded](http://blog.mathemagenic.com/2008/11/14/mamas-day-phd-work-and-being-grounded/), and her earlier post [Turning work into life](http://blog.mathemagenic.com/2004/06/06/turning-work-into-life/) (June 2004) in which she said:

> Don’t get me wrong, I like my work and office is a great space for meeting colleagues and serendipity of coffee talks. I’m just thinking about things what would make me more productive. A bit more flexibility, a bit more nature, a bit more fun… I know that there are organisations that make work fun and flexible to their people, but I wonder why they are so rare and what could be done to turn work into life. I guess one of the biggest obstacles is a myth about work/life balance, implying that work is not life, making us thinking that work should be that way - formal and full of discipline - and preventing thinking about other options…

Fortunate is the person who can make life their work and work their life.
