In his book, [Never Eat Alone](http://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Secrets-Relationship/dp/0385512058/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1227215359&sr=1-1), [Keith Ferrazzi](http://www.keithferrazzi.com/) has a section entitled "Balance is BS".  The "balance" he is referring to is the work/life balance that so many people talk about.  If you hadn't read the rest of the book, or if you don't know anything about Keith, you will likely be thinking, "This guy must be some kind of crazy workaholic."

But once you understand how he looks at balance, you realize that he may be a "workaholic", but he's far from crazy.  Consider this [quote on the subject](http://nevereatalone.typepad.com/blog/2008/07/tip-217---the-n.html#comments) from his blog last summer:

> But you’ve also probably heard or read me say that balance is BS – that if you’re living a life driven by genuine relationships, where you are constantly being yourself, it’s a lot harder to separate personal and professional into their own tidy boxes. This idea of “balance” we read about in newspapers – usually followed by a statistic about grueling American hours and a thumbs-up to the French 35-hr work week – also seems to be driven by the idea that work is inevitably bad and unpleasant. _Happy_ at … _work_!?! Incroyable!

Seems to me that Keith has discovered one of the secrets of the [Art of Living](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/the-art-of-living/).
