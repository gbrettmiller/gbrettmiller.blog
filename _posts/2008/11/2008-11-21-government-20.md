Stories earlier this week about [President-elect](http://www.fcw.com/online/news/154407-1.html) [Barack](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=&articleId=9121002&taxonomyId=&intsrc=kc_feat) [Obama](http://www.kansascity.com/273/story/897995.html) and his [Blackberry](http://www.fool.com/investing/value/2008/11/20/let-obama-be-obama.aspx) got me thinking about how our elected leaders and their staffs are (or not) using the potential of  "stuff 2.0" ("stuff" = "web", "enterprise", "KM", etc) in the execution of their duties.

For example:  It used  to make sense for Senators and Congressmen to basically live in Washington, DC and go back to their home districts on occasion; after all, they have to be present in order to vote.  But does that still make sense?

With the technology available for collaboration, and the security of PKI and other technologies to support digital voting, why not flip that around?  Set up your main base in your home state / district and travel to Washington, DC for special occassions.
