If you ask a competitive athlete if they have / need a coach the answers will likely range from "Yes" to "Of course" to "Are you kidding?". If you ask a [knowledge worker, or concept worker](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/from-knowledge-work-to-concept-work/), the same question the answers will likely range from "No" to "Huh?" to "Are you kidding?" Obviously, the "Are you kidding" answer has very different meanings in the two different contexts.

I've often wondered why this is: why is it acceptable, expected even, that athletes have and need coaches but considered a luxury if someone has a work/life coach and actually a detriment - a sign of weakness - if someone wants or needs a work/life coach?

The discussion around a recent [question on LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/professional-development/career-management/PRO_CMA/372291-335943?browseIdx=3&sik=1227617981509&goback=.abq_1_1227617981509_n_o_PRO) got me thinking about this again:

> Q: If you can't afford a coach, what are you doing to support your professional growth? A: I love (?) the assumptive nature of this question: that everyone needs a coach;...  Do professionals need coaches? No, certainly not.

The answer I quote above is just part of one response, but nearly all of the answers (so far) seem to dismiss the idea that a professional coach is desirable or needed.  The alternatives range from talk with friends, study the success of others, and read and continue to develop your knowledge on the subject of your job.

Going back to the world of sports, such an approach would be a sure path to the loser's circle (unless you are [Roger Federer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer#2004), of course).  What is it about our work as professionals in business that makes us different from the work of professionals in sports?
