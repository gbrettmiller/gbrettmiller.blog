I think this has been a long time coming, but it is finally time to retire the blog "29 Marbles."  There are several reasons behind this decision, but the biggest is that I'm tired of writing about autism separately from everything else, as if it is something apart from the rest of my life.  It's not.

I'll still be writing about autism, with the same random frequency as I do here, on a new blog I've started called [Theoria cum Praxi](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com).  Here is the [direct link to the autism category](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/category/autism/).  If you subscribe to the RSS feed and want to continue to receive updates, you don't have to do anything.  I'll be updating the feed info at Feedburner within the next couple of days.  Of course, feel free to subscribe to the full feed at [http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheoriaCumPraxi](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheoriacumPraxi).  This new blog will also fill in for the also retired [No Straight Lines](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com), so I will be addressing the life/work topics from there as well.

I hope to see you all there.
