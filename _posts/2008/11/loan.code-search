  39: I was reminded of this train of thought today when a colleague shared a link to a TEDx talk by [Pablo Martin de Holan](http://www.em-lyon.com/en/faculty-research-education/faculty-research/international-business-school-professors/Permanent-Professors/Pablo-MARTIN-DE-HOLAN) titled [Managing Organizational Forgetting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NzgEwye6Uk), based on a paper of the same name [published in the MIT Sloan Management Review](http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/managing-organizational-forgetting/). If you read my quotes above, I'm sure you understand why this opening paragraph from the paper grabbed my attention (emphasis at the end is mine):
  41: ⟪ 343 characters skipped ⟫and competitiveness of companies. Yet something is missing in the current discussions of organizational knowledge: **Companies don’t just learn; they also forget.** \--[Pablo Martin de Holan](http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/managing-organizational-forgetting/)
