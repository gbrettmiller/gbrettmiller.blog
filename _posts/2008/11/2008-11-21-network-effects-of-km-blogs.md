I, along with several others, [was interviewed last summer by Lilia Efimova](http://blog.mathemagenic.com/2008/11/20/blog-networking-study-interviews/) concerning my experiences as a Knowledge Management blogger using the blog as a networking tool.  (The interview came about from my blog [No Straight Lines](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com), which started out as a KM blog).  You can see a [summary of my interview here](http://blog.mathemagenic.com/phd/networking-practices-of-km-bloggers/brett-miller/).

The short of it is that I didn't start blogging with the purpose of networking with others in KM, but it was a (very) nice side effect.  I've met many people through blogging, KM and otherwise, that I never would have had the opportunity to get to know.
