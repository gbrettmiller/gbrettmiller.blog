Another song that brought my experiences with autism to mind, [Dream Theater](http://www.dreamtheater.net/)'s Solitary Shell, from the [Six Degrees of Separation CD](http://www.dreamtheater.net/disco_dreamtheater.php?s=6doit).

\= = == === =====

He seemed no different from the rest Just a healthy normal boy His mama always did her best And he was daddy's pride and joy

He learned to walk and talk on time But never cared much to be held And steadily he would decline Into his solitary shell

As a boy he was considered somewhat odd Kept to himself most of the time He would daydream in and out of his own world But in every other way he was fine

He's a monday morning lunatic Disturbed from time to time Lost withing himself In his solitary shell

A temporary catatonic Madman on occasion When will he break out Of his solitary shell

\===== === == = =

I have no idea if this song was written to be specifically about autism, but I doubt it.  It could just be about an extremely introverted kid.

The question that pops to mind:  Why does the child in the song need to "break out of his solitary shell" at all?
