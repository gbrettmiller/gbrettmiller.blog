Just to let you know, I'm going to be going through some blog maintenance over the next day or two, including an update of the [WordPress software](http://wordpress.org/) and databases and a possible template change (haven't decided about that one, yet). I'm also planning to import posts from the original [...no straight lines...](http://nsl.blogspot.com) from [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com), partly to have a consolidated collection of my writing but mainly to follow [my own advice](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/who-owns-your-data-who-should-own-it) (inspired by [Harold Jarche](http://www.jarche.com/?p=1401)) to "own my data."

I'm giving this warning because 1) I'm not sure what will happen when I import the posts, whether subscribers will get a blast of new posts or if there will be no effect, and 2) in case I screw something up you'll know that it is my fault - not my host, [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?209759) - and is (hopefully) temporary until I can figure it all out.

I've been keeping busy other places ([here](http://29marbles.blogspot.com), [here](http://www.stlouiselite.org), and [here](http://www.stlouiselite.org/meetmeinstlouis)), but do have a backlog of things to write about that I'll be posting soon.
