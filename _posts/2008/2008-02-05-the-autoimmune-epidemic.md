While wandering the aisles in the local [Borders](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/577394) book store, I saw [Donna Nakazawa](http://www.donnajacksonnakazawa.com/)'s new book, [The Autoimmune Epidemic: Bodies Gone Haywire in a World out of Balance and the Cutting Edge Science that Promises Hope](http://astore.amazon.com/29marbles-blog-20/detail/0743277759/002-9091504-7932015). This description is from the [book's official site](http://www.donnajacksonnakazawa.com/autoimmune_epidemic.htm):  

> Multiple sclerosis, lupus, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and nearly a hundred other chronic autoimmune illnesses are part of this devastating epidemic, in which the human body, acting on misread signals, literally begins to destroy itself. Alarmingly, the occurrence of many of these diseases has more than doubled in the last three decades, signaling a disturbing trend that can be directly tied to environmental factors in everyday modern lifeâ€”including our daily exposure to a dizzying array of toxic chemicals.

With the [conversation around a recent post](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2008/01/not-in-my-backyard-vaccines-autism-and.html) fresh in my mind, I was drawn to the book to see what the author had to say about autism in the context of this autoimmune epidemic. There is one section, consisting of two pages, where she mentions the possible relationship of autoimmune issues, vaccines, and heavy metals (specifically mercury in the form of thimerosol) to autism. I don't recall the specific wording, but she basically left it as, "We'll have to wait and see what comes of the research."  
  
Has anyone had a chance to read this book yet? Any thoughts?
