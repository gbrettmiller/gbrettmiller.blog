One of the key sub-plots in Elizabeth Moon's book [The Speed of Dark](http://www.speedofdark-thebook.com/) involves some corporate intrigue and an almost stereotypical management vs. labor conflict.   At the heart of the issue is a question of the efficiency vs. effectiveness of the autistic workforce.   It's probably because of my recent reading of the book that Jack Vinson's post [People still say these things?](http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2008/08/12/people_still_say_these_things.html) caught my attention.  ([Attention, what attention?](http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2008/08/26/attention_what_attention.html))

In that post, Jack references a quote that "amazes me every time I see it used in real life":

> Regrettably far too many executives remain firmly convinced that the only way to increase productivity is for their employees to work harder or faster. A chief executive in Northern Ireland was quoted in his company magazine as saying; _**"Any employee not producing value-added work all the time is a waste".**_ This attitude stems from the continued misunderstanding of productivity...

As I read this quote, what occurred in parallel in my thinking was the following:

> Regrettably far too many people remain firmly convinced that the only way to be of value to society is to do more faster. A 'normal' person might say; _**"Any autistic (or other disabled person) not keeping up with me and everyone else all the time is a waste".**_ This attitude stems from the continued misunderstanding of an individual's value to society.

If you are different, your difference has to be accounted for.  Doing that takes time, throws a proverbial wrench in the works.   And people with a plan to follow and schedule to keep don't like those wrenches.

I don't know where this attitude has come from, but I'd guess it has its deep roots in the Industrial Revolution and nourishment from the teachings of Scientific Management, Business Process Re-engineering, Total Quality Management, etc _ad infinitum_.

The mentality of work in our society has permeated our mentality of community.
