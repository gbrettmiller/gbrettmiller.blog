This is the third of three posts of excerpts from [Elizabeth Moon](http://www.elizabethmoon.com/)'s novel [The Speed of Dark](http://www.speedofdark-thebook.com/). (Part one - [How normal are normal people?](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/08/how-normal-are-normal-peoplehow-normal-are-normal-people), and part two - [What does it meant to be "me"?](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/08/what-does-it-mean-to-be-me))

In this excerpt, Lou is considering what it might mean to be "healed":

> If my self definition is limited and rule-dictated, at least it is my self-definition, and not someone else's. I like peppers on pizza and I do not like anchovies on pizza. If someone changes me, will I still like peppers and not anchovies on pizza? What if the someone who changes me wants me to want anchovies...can they change that?

> Asking if I want to be healed is like asking if I want to like anchovies. I cannot imagine what liking anchovies would feel like, what taste they would have in my mouth. People who like anchovies tell me they taste good; people who are normal tell me being normal feels good. They cannot describe the taste or the feeling in a way that makes sense to me.

> Do I need to be healed? Who does it hurt if I am not healed? Myself, but only if I feel bad the way i am, and I do not feel bad except when people say that I am not one of them, not normal. Supposedly autistic persons do not care what others think of them, but this is not true. I do care, and it hurts when people do not like me because I am autistic.

As I finished up my initial draft of this, I came across Estee's post [What do we think we know?](http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/2008/08/what-do-we-think-we-know.html) We know what it is like to be us, we know how to do things, we just can't always explain it.

Hopefully I'll have my full review done by the end of this (thankfully long) weekend.
