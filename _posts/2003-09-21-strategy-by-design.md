Do things just happen to you, are you just along for the ride? Are you getting where you want to go, or are you simply getting where you are going? A couple of old proverbs (I forget where from):  

> If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there.

> If you stay on the road you are on, you will end up where it takes you.
