> "Before you start reading this, I just want to make it clear that this is my solely opinion and perceptions that I have about being a Service Designer, and are based on my professional experience. I'm not defining the profession and I know that each one of us, as individuals, have different perceptions and definitions of it and, of course, it depends on the company we work for. So, I hope to make a good discussion from this post. Thank you!"
