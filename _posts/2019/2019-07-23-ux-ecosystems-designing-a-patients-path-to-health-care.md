> In order to adequately design for an ecosystem, we must evaluate touch points across a continuum. When we move across the continuum in this way, we are better able to identify the gaps in care patients receive, their pain points, and where the ecosystem breaks for them. This allows us to discover the failures in consistent care and explore solutions.
