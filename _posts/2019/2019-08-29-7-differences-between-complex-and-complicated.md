> Many people believe that complexity is just higher order complicatedness i.e. that there is a continuum and that the difference is one of degree, not type.  When one considers however how very different these states are from each other, I tend to agree with [Dave Snowden](https://cognitive-edge.com/blog/liminal-cynefin/) when he says that there are in fact phase shifts between them i.e. they are fundamentally different types of systems.

> Why is this important:  as long as decision-makers believe they are dealing with complicated systems, they will assume they are able to control outcomes; find solutions to problems and waste a lot of money on expert consultants to give them the “answers”. For organisations to become more resilient and sustainable, business science simply has to move beyond its Newtonian foundations towards an understanding of complexity.
