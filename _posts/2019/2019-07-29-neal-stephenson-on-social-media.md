> Mr. Stephenson’s observation corresponds to my experience of social media (especially Twitter): It’s not that folks are talking past each other, it’s that they’re not even interacting with people who don’t share their mental models.... To talk of filter bubbles is misleading: these aren’t tenuous membranes; they’re thick, hardened shells.
