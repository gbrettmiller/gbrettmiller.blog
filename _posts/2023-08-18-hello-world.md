Believe it or not, before social media, blogs were how people connected, shared, and learned from each other. And how we just wrote. How we thought out loud, even if no one was listening. Truth be told, I miss that. So here I am.

I started blogging back in the summer of 2003 as I was exploring and learning about knowledge management, with a desire to share what I was learning and to connect with others of like mind. Over time that expanded to include complexity, Enterprise 2.0, working out loud, a whole bunch of things. I eventually created another blog to share my experiences as a parent, especially as father to an autistic son, and to connect and learn from others. Then combined them. (There is a much longer story to all this, but you don't really want to hear it.) 

If you'd like to see all my stuff from June 2003 to June 2023, you can find it at [no straight lines](https://gbrettmiller.wordpress.com). I may, or may not, eventually move some or all of that content here. 

These days I'm on a learning binge of service design, customer experience, journey management, and - yes - generative AI and large language models (LLM). So this new blog will include a lot of all those things, plus a healthy assortment of random. 

For those who are curious, I've chosen to use Jekyll as the blogging software and GitHub Pages as the publishing platform. Jekyll because I love (love love) the static site it generates (yes, old school web geek here who longs for simple days of simple HTML pages). GitHub Pages mainly because it is free, but also because it is easy (aka serverless and I don't have to deal with infrastructure).
