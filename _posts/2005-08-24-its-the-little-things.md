Life with autism is full of big problems and issues, so the little things sometimes fall by the wayside. For instance, riding a bike - a two wheeler. But what is bigger to most kids than being able to ride your bike around the neighborhood? If you've ever tried to teach an autistic child to ride a two-wheeler, you know the challenges. They are the same as for other kids, just a bit more difficult.  
  
I have to admit, we gave up and went with an [adult tricycle](http://brandscycle.com/site/showitem.cfm?Category=144&searchtype=Category&Catalog=39). Not quite the same as a two-wheeler, but Zeke loves it. I think he likes the freedom to get out and ride around, not to mention the wind in his face. We still want to work with him on a two-wheeler, and I think I've found one possible approach at [Lose the Training Wheels](http://www.losethetrainingwheels.org).  
  
The expressed goals of this web site are fourfold -- to educate all who will listen:

1. That bike riding can be efficiently and safely taught,
2. That the universe of people capable of riding bikes is larger and less restrictive than previously realized,
3. To introduce you to some insights regarding the bicycle that may have escaped your attention up to now, and
4. To have a little fun with the bicycle as an intellectual challenge.

There is more information in [Adapted Bicycles for Teaching  
Riding Skills](http://journals.sped.org/tec/articles/Klein37-6.pdf) (.pdf file), published in the July 05 issue of [**Teaching Exceptional Children**](http://journals.sped.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=tec_toc).  
  
For those in the Delaware/Maryland/Virginia area, the 2005 Lower Delaware Autism Foundation Adaptive Bike Camp will be held at Mariner Middle School in Milton Monday, Aug. 29 to Friday, Sept. 2.
