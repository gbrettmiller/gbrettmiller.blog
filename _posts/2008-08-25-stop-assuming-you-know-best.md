I came across the following in Michael Dowd's [Thank God for Evolution](http://www.thankgodforevolution.com/):

> To have a powerful relationship with your own intuition and instincts - and thus to have a clear channel of communication with the creating, sustaining Life Force of the Universe (whatever you may choose to call It/Him/Her) - one must cultivate humility in this sense: **_Stop assuming that you know best how things are supposed to go in the world_**. Rather, try on an attitude of gratitude - not just for what is easy to be grateful for, but also for those challenges and difficulties in life for which you cannot yet detect a silver lining.
> 
> Having faith and being in integrity means trusting that each and every one of us is doing the best we can, given what we've got to work with at the time. It's trusting that, from the perspective of the Universe, everything may be "right on schedule."

Just thought I'd share.
