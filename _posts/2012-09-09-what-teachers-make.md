When did teaching start being seen as such a bad career choice, the last resort of "those who can't"? We (as a collective society) revere coaches in sports, and go to great lengths to find great coaches for our precocious little athletes.

Why don't we give the same respect and support to, and expect the same greatness from, our kids' first "life coaches", their teachers?
