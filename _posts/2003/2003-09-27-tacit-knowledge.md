From [Tacit Dimension](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/038506988X/gbrettmiller-20), Polanyi (1966):  

> ...the notion of tacit "knowing": here, the outcome of the action is the focal, or [proximal](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=proximal), point and the doing (achieving the outcome) is characterised as a [distal](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=distal) process. Through practice, the attention of the doer is focused on the outcome rather than the means of achieving the outcome.
