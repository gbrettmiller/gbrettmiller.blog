As I was putting together a business case to focus on making better use of the IT assets we currently own instead of buying/developing more, I received an e-mail notification for [Time to Make Tech Work (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox)](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030915.html). Perfect timing.  
  
Though the article is full of good ideas, three of them stand out for me (in my current situation):

  
- Security as default  
    
- e-mail must be reconceptualized (also discussed in [another AlertBox entry](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990919.html))  
    
- We need an Internet Control Panel...
