I am about 100 pages into Geoffrey West's book, **[Scale](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/314049/scale-by-geoffrey-west/),** and am having a hard time not just skipping ahead to the parts about cities and companies.

Cities, West says, scale superlinearly (aka increasing returns to scale) whereas companies scale sublinearly (aka economy of scale). Which is why cities typically last a long time, and companies (and animals, for that matter) typically die young.

What if you could structure your company to scale superlinearly? Is it possible? If so, how would you go about making that happen? Would you even want it to happen, or is it a good thing that companies "die" young?
