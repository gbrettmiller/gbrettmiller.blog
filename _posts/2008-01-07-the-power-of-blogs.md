Last July, US Army MAJ Andy Olmstead wrote a blog entry to be published in the event of his death. MAJ Olmstead died in Iraq last week, you can [read his final post here](http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2008/01/andy-olmsted.html).

I have several items in my “to blog” basket, but I was thinking about this story most of the weekend and just couldn’t write about anything else. I’ve been trying to think of something to say, but in the end I think it speaks for itself and shows just how powerful blogs can be. (Others have been able to write a bit more on the subject, check out this [page on the Rocky Mountain News](http://www.blogrunner.com/snapshot/D/7/2/rocky_blogger_major_andrew_olmsted_killed_in_iraq/) for links.)
