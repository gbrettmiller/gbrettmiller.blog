"Keep me in the loop."

This all too common expression is - or should be - the bane of anyone trying to implement, or just use, a social media approach to collaboration and communication. What it really means is...

> "I want to know what's going on with your project, but I don't care enough to actually spend my own time keeping up with what's going, so please take time out of your own busy schedule and figure out what information I need to know and then make sure you get it to me. I may or may not bother to read it once you've sent it to me."

The next time someone asks you to "keep me in the loop", let them know where the conversation is happening and offer to grant them access. If they don't take you up on it, then they don't really care. If they do take you up on it, they may never join in. But they might, and their participation will be that much more valuable because they are there intentionally, not accidentally.

Of course, this goes both ways. Next time someone talks to you about a project that you are interested in, don't ask them to keep you in the loop. Instead, ask them, "How can I join the conversation?"
