The absolute best user interface idea ever in a car is that little arrow next to the fuel pump icon on the fuel gauge, you know the one I mean. (And if you've never noticed this before, you're welcome :)

Maybe not absolutely necessary after you've had your car for a while, but very (very) useful when driving an unfamiliar car, like a rental. Other than that, I have to admit never really paying much attention to the fuel gauge in a car (at least not until the low fuel light starts blinking!). Not until I found myself in one of those aforementioned rental cars, anyway.

In my experience the fuel gauge in most vehicles, such as my Nissan Frontier, is based on textual indicators, specifically **Full** and **Empty**.

On the other hand, the VW Passat I once rented had a a gauge based on numerical indicators, with a full tank represented by **1** and an empty tank interestingly not indicated by either text or number.

Fuel Gauge in VW Passat

Having the fuel gauge top out at **1**, with the halfway point being **1/2** and empty (presumably) **0**, is somewhat reasonable in a mathematical sense. And interestingly, the value of "half" works in either/both the textual and numerical senses.

But most people aren't really interested in the math of the situation, they're not thinking, "Oh, I'm almost at **zero** fuel." They're thinking (as the low fuel light blinks at them), "Oh, the tank is almost **empty**."

I can't help wondering how the systems engineers and the user experience team at VW decided to use **1** to indicate a full tank. What was the decision-making process, and what were the evaluation criteria? Is this a case of engineers being engineers? Perhaps a cultural thing, something uniquely German? Or is there something else at play here?

If you know, please share.
