On my [other blog](http://nsl.blogspot.com) I recently posted [some thoughts](http://nsl.blogspot.com/2005/09/changing-resistance-into-understanding.html) on the book [They just don't get it](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/157675328X&link_code=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&tag=gbrettmiller-20&creative=9325), a sort of business case-study of two "opposing" sides. Key to the resolution of the story in the book is the importance of seeing the question (and solution) from the "other" side. While reading the book, the neurodiversity vs. bio-med debate kept popping into my mind, especially with all the various back and forth lately.  
  
If you've not already seen it, you really should visit [Injecting Sense](http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/) and read [Semantics and Civility](http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/semantics-and-civility.html). Wade has put together an excellent synthesis of the many topics and ideas that have been floating around the past couple of weeks which I think goes a long way to helping frame this debate from all sides.  
  
No one is right, no one is wrong, but there is a way ahead in which everyone comes out ahead.
