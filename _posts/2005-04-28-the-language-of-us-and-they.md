We first came across [this poem](http://www.shevin.org/articles-harmonica.html) by [Mayer Shevin](http://www.shevin.org/bio.html) many years ago when we were first coping with a diagnosis of autism, and found copies of it recently when were doing some spring cleaning. You can find more about it at the links above, but I've included it below:

> We like things.  
> They fixate on Objects.  
>   
> We try to make friends.  
> They display attentions seeking behavior.  
>   
> We take a break.  
> They display off-task behaviors.  
>   
> We stand up for ourselves.  
> They are non-compliant.  
>   
> We have hobbies.  
> They self-stim.  
>   
> We choose our friends wisely.  
> They display poor socialization.  
>   
> We persevere.  
> They perseverate.  
>   
> We love people.  
> They have dependencies on people.  
>   
> We go for a walk.  
> They run away.  
>   
> We insist.  
> They tantrum.  
>   
> We change our minds.  
> They are disoriented and have short attention span.  
>   
> We have talents.  
> They have SPLINTER SKILLS.  
>   
> We are human.  
> They are ?????????????????

Kind of takes me back to [Luke's question](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/03/freaks-geeks-and-aspergers-syndrome.html), "When is an obsession not an obsession."
