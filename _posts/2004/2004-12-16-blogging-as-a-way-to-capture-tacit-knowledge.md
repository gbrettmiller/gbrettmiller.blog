From the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) definition of [tacit knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge) is this short paragraph:

> By definition, tacit knowledge is not easily shared. One of Polanyi's famous aphorisms is: "We know much more than we can tell." Tacit knowledge consists often of habits and culture that we do not recognize in ourselves.

In a brief conversation through blog posts and comments, Lilia Efimova and Richard MacManus talk about the "unfinished" feeling that goes with blogs and how it affects work on "finished" products. A couple of quotes:

> From Lilia in [What if...](http://blog.mathemagenic.com/2004/12/15.html#a1456):  
>   
> Although often I escape into blogging when I don't feel like working on a larger, "finished" pieces, I guess I really need those pressures to produce something finished to take an extra effort for synthesising "always unfinished" into something "finished".  
>   
> From Richard in [Weblog Reading And Writing: Always Unfinished?](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002546.php):  
>   
> Having written an article for Digital Web Magazine (and I must get around to writing another one), I can confirm it takes at least a couple of weeks to 'craft'. Whereas with my weblog, although generally I write carefully crafted long-form posts, it's still of-the-moment and a lot of times it's an ongoing theme I'm exploring (ie it's not "finished").

As both Lilia and Richard imply, the writing (and reading) of blogs is a way to collect and organize (and reassess as needed) various thoughts and ideas as they are formed and processed. Sounds like tacit knowledge to me.
