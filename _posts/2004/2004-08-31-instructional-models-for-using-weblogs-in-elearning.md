From [EduBlogInsights](http://anvil.gsu.edu/EduBlogInsights/2004/08/04) is a discussion of [Instructional Models for Using Weblogs in eLearning: Case Studies from a Hybrid and Virtual Course](http://www.syllabus.com/news_article.asp?id=9829&typeid=156), published in [Syllabus](http://www.syllabus.com) magazine. The article includes survey results and observations from the integration of blogging into online and hybrid courses over the last year at the University of Arizona.  
  
In various blogs and posts over the last few months, I've seen several discussions of what a blog isn't, what a blog is, what blogs should have, what they shouldn't have. This article, and some of the insights from it, go a long way to show that a blog is a blog. You use what works, you don't worry about what doesn't, and you do your thing.
