As you've probably noticed, this blog is a bit of stream of consciousness, a bit of pre-planned thought, and a lot of wandering around. I truly use it as a personal wastebook (wasteblog?) and you will likely see many topics come round and round. I am also in the process, though, of putting together a plan for using blogs as a means of content management (loaded term, I know) and info/knowledge sharing for organizations.  
  
Looking for some ideas on how to use blogs as an organizational tool, I came across several good ideas, such as [Blogs in Business: The Weblog as Filing Cabinet](http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/categories/businessInnovation/2003/03/03.html) from Dave Pollard's [**how to save the world**](http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/). Especially useful, and a good jumping off point for getting more good ideas, is [More Corporate Blogging Resources](http://blog.contentious.com/archives/000149.html) from Amy Gahran's [**...Contentious**](http://blog.contentious.com).  
  
In addition to the increasingly common corporate uses for blogs (internal sharing, face to the public, etc.), I'm looking at using blogs as a key part of a web site for a K-12 school for everything from school announcements to PTO shared blogs. Any ideas or examples are welcome.
