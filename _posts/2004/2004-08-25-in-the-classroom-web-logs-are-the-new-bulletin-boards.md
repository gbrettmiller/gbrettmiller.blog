An article from the New York Times online, [In the Classroom, Web Logs Are the New Bulletin Boards](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/19/technology/circuits/19blog.html?ex=1093919900&ei=1&en=f80034edb6efaa97) discusses the role that blogs can play in the classroom. An excellent example of how blogs can be much more than just a way to say something, they can actually be a way to help you say things better.  
  
As the article notes, it is also a way to "even the playing field" so that the quiet students that may not get a spoken work in edge-wise can have there voice heard in the group.
