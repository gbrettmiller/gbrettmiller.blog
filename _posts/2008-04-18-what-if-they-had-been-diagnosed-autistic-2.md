In his book [Unstrange Minds: Remapping the World of Autism](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465027644?ie=UTF8&tag=29marbles-blog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0465027644)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=29marbles-blog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0465027644), author Roy Richard Grinker mentions chess legend Bobby Fischer (p. 63) as someone who may have been an undiagnosed autistic. I've just started reading David Edmonds' book [Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How A Lone American Star Defeated the Soviet Chess Machine (P.S.)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060510250?ie=UTF8&tag=29marbles-blog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060510250)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=29marbles-blog-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0060510250), and have to say that I was thinking the same thing. (For more discussion on the subject check out the [Bobby Fischer talk page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bobby_Fischer#Asperger_Syndrome "Talk: Bobby Fischer - Wikipedia") on Wikipedia.)

Which got me thinking: If Fischer were indeed autistic, how would his life - and the history of chess, among other things - have been different if he had been diagnosed when he was young? If he had been provided the treatment and services that are typically demanded today for Asperger's diagnoses, would he have had the impact he did? Would he have been **able** to have that impact, or would that ability have been "treated" out of him?

You can extend this to any of the great minds that people sometimes say were probably autistic, like Newton, Einstein, Van Gogh. You could also look at those who have been diagnosed with Asperger's as an adult and think back on how things may have been different, for them and their contributions, if they had been diagnosed younger.

There is no doubt (in my mind, anyway) that the increase in diagnoses of autism, especially Asperger's, is due to a better understanding of what Asperger's is and an increased desire of parents to understand why their kids are "different". Many are being diagnosed now that might not have been diagnosed before, and demanding (and receiving) treatment they may not have received before.

I can't help wondering what these individuals - and the world - may be missing out on because we want to catch and "fix" their differences early in life. We want to make life "easier" for these kids and their parents in the short term, but what is the impact to the long term? (This is kind of a different take on my earlier question, "[What would a world without autism look like?](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/04/a-world-without-autism/ "29 Marbles - A world without autism")")

_(Just to be clear, I'm not advocating not diagnosing children - or adults - if a diagnosis is warranted. I'm just asking the question because I think the answers, even if only hypothetical, can give us some insight into why we think the way we do about autism and why we do the things we do about autism.)_

UPDATE: As I finished writing this, I saw [Your Advice Requested: Next Steps for a Teen Diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome?](http://autism.about.com/b/2008/04/18/your-advice-requested-next-steps-for-a-teen-diagnosed-with-asperger-syndrome.htm "About.com Autism:  Your Advice Requested...") over at About.com. The questions I've asked in this post were a hypothetical to get you thinking about what impact a diagnosis and subsequent treatment would have had on an undiagnosed autistic. If you've had a chance to consider those questions, your thoughts on them should help you come up with an answer to Lisa's question.
