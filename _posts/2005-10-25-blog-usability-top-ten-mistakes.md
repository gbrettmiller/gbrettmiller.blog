Why do you blog? There are many answers to that question, ranging from "I just need a place to write down my thoughts" to "I want to change the world (and get rich doing it)." Your answer to that question should play a large part in how you blog. Or at least how you design your blog.  
  
On that note is [Jakob Nielsen](http://www.useit.com/)'s latest installment of his [Alert Box](http://www.useit.com/alertbox) column, [Weblog Usability: The Top Ten Design Mistakes](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/weblogs.html).

> Weblogs are a form of website. The [thousands of normal website usability guidelines](http://www.nngroup.com/reports/ "Nielsen Norman Group: research reports about the usability of websites, intranets, and email newsletters") therefore apply to them, as do [this year's top ten design mistakes](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/designmistakes.html "Alertbox: Top Ten Web Design Mistakes of 2005"). But weblogs are also a special genre of website; they have unique characteristics and thus distinct usability problems.

> To reach new readers and respect your existing readers' time constraints, test your weblog against the following usability problems.
> 
> 1. No author biographies
> 2. No author photo
> 3. Nondescript posting titles
> 4. Links don't say where they go
> 5. Classic hits are buried
> 6. The calendar is the only navigation
> 7. Irregular publishing frequency
> 8. Mixing topics
> 9. Forgetting that you are writing for your future boss
> 10. Having a domain name owned by a weblog service

Obviously, not all of these apply to everyone; it all depends on what you want to accomplish with your blog. Still, I think I have some work to do.
