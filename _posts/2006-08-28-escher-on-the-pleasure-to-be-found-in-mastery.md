From my [M. C. Escher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher "M. C. Escher - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") calendar:

> There is indeed great satisfaction in acquiring skill, in coming to thoroughly understand the qualities of the material at hand and in learning to use the instruments we have - in the first place, our hands! - in an effective and controlled way.
