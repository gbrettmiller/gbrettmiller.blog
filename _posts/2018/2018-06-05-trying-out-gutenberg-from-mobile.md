Sitting here at the WordPress West meetup celebrating the 15th anniversary of WordPress, the conversation inevitably came around to Gutenberg. So of course I installed it so I can try it out, give it a spin.

Celebrating 15 years of WordPress

Working off my iPhone SE, it was easy enough to install and activate the plugin for use on this site. Very quick install, editor immediately available. 

Adding new blocks, such as the image block above, was simple and straightforward: just click on the (+) icon and the options appear.

The block options in Gutenberg 

Just click the block you want and away you go. Looking forward to giving Gutenberg a proper exploration.
