Achieving mastery can take a long time. This is especially true if you are pursuing mastery in something other than your profession, when you have only limited time to dedicate to the 'hobby.' As a result, many people look for a "quick-fix" to achieve final results without actually learning anything.

So it was nice to see Paolina's post at Green Chameleon about her pursuit of mastery in _salsa_, and the unexpected rewards that pursuit brought her way.

> When I first started to salsa in 1998, the result of my sister having won two free passes for 6 lessons, I was immediately hooked on the dance and after those 6 lessons, signed on and went faithfully every weekend to dance class for 2 years. Since then, there has been the occasional salsa workshop or choreography I would do, or performance at events, as a hobby.

Dance, like the martial arts, is one of those areas where you can learn some steps, learn a routine, and perform it relatively well, but not be able to actually apply that routine to another situation. You haven't really learned **to** dance, you've learned **a** dance.

This is reflective of how organizations go about knowledge management: Some want **to manage their knowledge**, and some want **a knowledge management system**. The latter is easy to do, anyone will sell you a knowledge management system. Actually understanding what your organization knows and being able to use it to further your organization's goals, on the other hand, is a master's journey that, unfortunately, too few seem willing to take.
