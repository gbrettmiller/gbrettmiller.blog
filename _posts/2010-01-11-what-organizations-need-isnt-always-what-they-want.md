From Seth Godin's recent article [Why ask why?](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/why-ask-why.html)

> The secret to creativity is curiosity... The student with no curiosity... is no problem at all. Lumps are easily managed.
> 
> Same thing is true for most of the people we hire. We'd like them to follow instructions, not ask questions, not question the status quo.

This reminded me of something I jotted down in my notebook from Richard Farson's book [Management of the Absurd](http://www.amazon.com/Management-Absurd-Richard-Farson/dp/0684830442/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1214596820&sr=8-1):

> Real creativity, the kind that is responsible for breakthrough changes in our society, always violates the rules. That is why it is so unmanageable and that is why, in most organizations, when we say we desire creativity we really mean manageable creativity. We don’t mean raw, dramatic, radical creativity that requires us to change.

As much as organizations say they want to be innovative and groundbreaking, they usually don’t mean they **want** each of their individual employees to be innovative and groundbreaking.

Even though that is often exactly what they **need**.
