On the [recommendation](http://www.corante.com/brainwaves/archives/2005/03/07/blogging_begets_better_brains.php) of Zack at [Brain Waves](http://www.corante.com/brainwaves), I took a look at the [Eide Neurolearning Blog](http://eideneurolearningblog.blogspot.com/). The blog covers a wide range of topics related to learning, specifically the different ways that different people learn. As you might expect, the blog also addresses some autism related topics.  
  
The blog itself is a somewhat recent replacement for an e-mail newsletter that is a companion to the Eide's main website, [Neurolearning.com](http://neurolearning.com). The [Autism Archive](http://neurolearning.com/autism_archives.htm) addresses "theoretical" topics such as Visual Side of Autism Architecture of Empathy, Science of Autism Ill-Defined as well as more "practical" topics such as Autism Spectrum Disorders - Why Does it Take 10 Minutes to Diagnose? and Music Therapy for Autism.  
  
The other topics are quite interesting as well and include Gifted & Creative Thinking, Learning Styles, Dyslexia, Mathematical Thinking, and Computers, Video Games, and Learning. I've just started going through the whole of the archives, but I like what I see so far. I think you'll like it, too.
