Paper Prototyping: How-To Training Video from Nielsen Norman Group.](http://www.ciadvertising.org/studies/student/98_fall/theory/hornor/paper1.html)  
  
I've not seen the DVD, but I'm sure it lives up to the high standards .NN/g adheres to on everything else they do. Basically, it shows techniques for, as the title states, Paper Prototyping.  
  
I can't attest to the techniques they espouse, but the basic concept is, it seems to me, common sense and I've used it for quite a few things. Even if you are just using it for yourself as a way to figure out how to do something, it is a worthwhile technique.  
  
And I'm sure this DVD is well worth the $50 (+ $3 s&h).
