A few days ago, I [posted about an article](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/12/art-as-insight-into-autistic-mind.html) about Jonathon Lerman, an 18 year-old autistic artist with an exhibition in Toronto. Turns out the organizer of the exhibition, Est√©e Klar-Wolfond, is also the mother of a 3 year-old autistic son.  
  
Check out her blog, [My Son's Autism](http://joyofautism.blogspot.com).
