I started blogging back in the summer of 2003 as I was exploring and learning about knowledge management, with a desire to share what I was learning and to connect with others of like mind. Over time that expanded to include complexity, Enterprise 2.0, working out loud, a whole bunch of things. I eventually created another blog to share my experiences as a parent, especially as father to an autistic son, and to connect and learn from others. Then combined them. (There is a much longer story to all this, but you don't really want to hear it.)  

Believe it or not, before social media, blogs were how people connected, shared, and learned from each other. And how we just wrote. How we thought out loud, even if no one was listening. Truth be told, I miss that. 

But the past is the past, and my wonderings are taking me to new places.

These days I'm on a learning binge of service design, customer experience, journey management, and - yes - generative AI and large language models (LLM). In general, of course, but specifically how all of that can be put to use improving the digital delivery of government services. 

I'm putting the final touches on my new beginnings, where I will once again be wondering out loud.This archive holds my "past", which I hope will continue to be of interest and of value. To both you and me.
