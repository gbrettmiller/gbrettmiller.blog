I found this bit of wisdom in the book [Never Eat Alone](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0385512058&link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&tag=gbrettmiller-20&creative=9325) by Keith Ferrazzi. Though geared at self improvement, this quote struck a chord with me as a parent:

> The trick is not to work obsessively on the skills and talents you lack, but to focus and cultivate your strengths so that your weaknesses matter less.

The [story of Tony DeBlois](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/09/genius-comes-in-many-forms-review-of.html) is an example of this in action. His mother recognized that Tony had serious weaknesses/disabilities to overcome, but also realized that his strength in music could make much of that weakness irrelevant.  
  
I think all of our kids have their own strengths. Much of it may be hidden from us as parents\*, or their strength may be something that we don't quite understand or appreciate as worth cultivating.  
  
But it is by cultivating these strengths, in **all** of our kids (and ourselves), that we can help them be successful in whatever they ultimately decide to do.
