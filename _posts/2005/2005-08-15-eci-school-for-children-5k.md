For the runners in the group, if you can make it to Eatontown, NJ (Monmouth County) on September 18 make sure you check out the [ECI School for Children 5K](https://www.sfconline.org/Application.aspx). This was Zeke's school until very recently (when we moved to St. Louis), and I can't say enough good things about the school and its various programs. If I wasn't half-way across the country, you can bet I would be there (even though my running times aren't quite what they used to be!!)  
  
If you do make it to the run, I'd love to hear how it goes.
