Blogs have become a great way for those of us living with Autism to share our stories, but I would say that the audience for blogs is still somewhat small. An opportunity to share with a potentially larger audience through a traditional print publication (a book) is available for those interested through the "A Cup of Comfort" anthology.

> **A Cup of Comfort** is a bestselling anthology series featuring compelling true stories about the experiences and relationships that inspire and enrich our lives. These engaging personal essays — written by people from all walks of life — are carefully selected for inclusion in A Cup of Comfort based on originality, creativity, emotional impact, and substance.  
>   
> We are now seeking submissions for the following books:  
>   
> **A Cup of Comfort for Parents of Children with Autism**  
>   
> A child's diagnosis of autism can turn the parents' world upside-down and inside-out. The incidence of this mysterious neurobiological disorder has risen dramatically in recent years, leaving thousand of parents in search of answers, support, and hope. Yet, for all its challenges and the changes it might bring to family life, autism is not without positives and promise. For this inspirational volume, we seek _personal anecdotal stories_ (not prescriptive articles) about the unique aspects of parenting a child with autism and related disorders (Asperger syndrome, Rett's disorder, disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder).  
>   
> Possible themes include but are not limited to: impact on other members of family; creative solutions to everyday challenges; breakthroughs; effective treatments; silver linings; tender moments; helpful support; unexpected positive outcomes; blessings large and small; reasons for hope; adult children with autism. We are most interested in stories written by parents, but will also consider and likely publish some stories written by professionals and family members or friends with intimate knowledge of the child and parents in question.  
>   
> Submission Deadline: November 15, 2005 (extended from Oct. 1)  
>   
> Note : Submissions are reviewed throughout the submission period; early entry is encouraged. Deadlines are sometimes extended.
