I finally got around to installing [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/) on my [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows) laptop (now that I’m no longer constrained by a ruthless SysAdmin).  My initial impression:  I love it.  
  
I tried out each of the modes available (Sidebar, Deskbar, and Floating Deskbar), and found that the plain old Deskbar works best for how I use it.  It just sits on the task bar in the bottom right waiting for me to use it.  I also set up the [Outlook](http://www.microsoft.com/outlook) search bar, which almost makes [Outlook](http://www.microsoft.com/outlook) as good as [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com/) for findability of old e-mails.  (In fact, I pull my [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com/) down into [Outlook](http://www.microsoft.com/outlook) via PoP3, mainly so I have all my accounts available in one place, on- or off-line.)  
  
While it is handy to be able to find files, documents, and e-mails very quickly, I’d have to say my favorite aspect of [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/) is that it finds and makes available offline cached web sites I’ve visited.  Right now, for instance, I’m sitting in the Minneapolis/St. Paul airport and unable to connect to the HotSpot they have.  I wanted to read in detail a site I glanced at last night.  Instead of having to save the page last night, I just go into [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/) today.    
  
I’ve also been using [Spotlight](http://www.apple.com/spotlight) on my [iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac), but haven’t quite given it the workout that [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/) has received.  First impressions there are very favorable as well.  
  
**What about Getting Things Done ®?**  
  
When [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/) first came out, I remember reading a posting by [David Allen](http://www.davidco.com/) of GTD fame in which he lamented the “disorganization” that a desktop search would bring.  Having used [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/) for a while now, I have to say that I disagree with that assessment.  
  
I use GTD (at least, a “customized” version of it) to help me through the various projects I am involved in.  The [GTD Outlook Add-in](http://www.netcentrics.com/news/gtdannounce.cfm) is invaluable.  But I do so much reading, research, and writing online outside of my formal processes that it is impossible (or, at the least, impractical) to impose any kind of structure on them.  [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com/) allows me to indulge the free-association part of my brain.  When I need information to support a project, it is just a few keystrokes away.
