[The Cincinnati Post - Noah, for one, is peeling back the layers of autism](http://news.cincypost.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050507/LIFE02/505070319/1007/LIFE) gives one mother's example of why you should never give up hope:

> Terri says Noah is emerging from autism. The official word from the medical establishment on autism is that there's no cure. But Terri says the establishment is wrong. She insists Noah is coming back to her, getting better. His drawings suggest she's right.

A fairly long article by online newspaper standards, but lots of good information.  
  
I also heartily recommend reading [Unraveling the Mystery of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder : A Mother's Story of Research & Recovery](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0767907981&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=gbrettmiller-20&creative=9325) by Karyn Seroussi. Excellent insights into the effect of diet on autism.
