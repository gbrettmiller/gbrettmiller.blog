I use [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) as my RSS reader. I have a habit of checking the "Keep New" box on posts that I would like to read in more detail or post about. Checking the box would change the description display to indicate that there was a new post in the subscription.  
  
Unfortunately, I tend to have a lot of these. Which meant that I would quite often open a feed thinking there were new posts only to find that there were only old posts I'd marked as new. Kind of a pain.  
  
That changed a week or so ago. The Bloglines interface now gives an indication of how many truly new feeds I have as well as the number of old feeds that I've marked to keep as new. They've tried out a couple of different ways of displaying this. Here are the ones I've seen, they may have gone through a couple of other iterations when I wasnt' looking:

- 1 : 2
- (1) (2)
- (1) (2)

A definite improvement.  
  
On the other hand, MSN has updated their service in a (for me) negative way. I have an MSN account that I've used for a while, though it mostly gets junk traffic these days. Since I prefer to not have to check numerous sites/sources for my mail, I have (had) Outlook set up to check the MSN account. While trying to clear out some old messages, I got an error dialog that basically said, "If you want to keep accessing MSN through Outlook, you need to pay us."  
  
Guess I'm not going to use MSN through Outlook anymore.
