The [Brookings Institution](http://www.brookings.edu) is holding a conference entitled [Autism and Hope](http://www.brookings.edu/comm/events/20051216autism.htm) this Friday 16 December from 2:00 - 6:00 pm.

> The Brookings Institution, in conjunction with The Help Group of Los Angeles and with the additional support of the Karmazin Foundation, Autism Speaks, Cure Autism Now, and Michael Fux, will hold a conference to examine policy proposals for expanding the availability and affordability of early intervention for ASD. Drawing on a variety of expert opinions, the conference aims to illustrate that autism and hope are no longer mutually exclusive.
