In support of local efforts here in New Jersey, I've signed up as an "[Autism Awareness Ambassador](http://www.njcosac.org/incautaware)" for the [NJ Center for Outreach & Services for Autism Community](http://www.njcosac.org/cosacindex), or more simply [COSAC](http://www.njcosac.org/cosacindex). Their mission statement (quoted from their website):

> COSAC is a non-profit agency providing information and advocacy, services, family and professional education and consultation. COSAC encourages responsible basic and applied research that would lead to a lessening of the effects and potential prevention of autism. COSAC is dedicated to ensuring that all people with autism receive appropriate, effective services to maximize their growth potential and to enhancing the overall awareness of autism in the general public.

As part of my ambassador duties, I've also set up [a page](http://njcosac.kintera.org/faf/r.asp?t=4&i=93790&u=93790-74240505&e=252130969) as part of COSAC's [online fundraising campaign](http://njcosac.kintera.org/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=93790&lis=0&kntae93790=0B0CD966F0454FC6836B9AEE2DF4035B) for Autism Awareness month. I've set a modest goal of US$500 and am posting this notice here (and [here](http://nsl.blogspot.com/2005/04/april-is-autism-awareness-month.html)) as well as sending out some e-mails to friends and family. While COSAC is primarily an NJ organization, the work they do ultimately benefits us all.
