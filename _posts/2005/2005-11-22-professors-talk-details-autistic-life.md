Another "success story" of an adult Aspie at [Western Front Online - Professor’s talk details autistic life](http://www.westernfrontonline.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/11/22/438376f05ce16).

> Western adjunct anthropology professor Dawn Prince-Hughes, 41, was diagnosed with a form of autism called Asperger’s syndrome when she was 36 years old. In her book, titled [Songs of the Gorilla Nation : My Journey Through Autism](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/1400082153&tag=gbrettmiller-20&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1400082153) Prince-Hughes said Asperger’s syndrome is characterized by difficulties processing stimuli, sensory oversensitivities and challenges in social interaction.

One of the questions that comes up ocassionally for parents is, "[Should I tell my autistic son/daughter that they are autistic?](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/09/im-glad-im-not-autistic.html)" Prince-Hughes description of what she felt when she found out points us in the right direction.

> Prince-Hughes began learning about Asperger’s syndrome as an adult, after doctors diagnosed a young relative with Asperger’s. Prince-Hughes compiled detailed memories from her childhood and examples of her symptoms of the syndrome, then called a psychiatrist for a diagnosis when she was 36 years old.  
>   
> The diagnosis had a major impact on her life, Prince-Hughes said. Rather than making her feel abnormal or separated from others, Prince-Hughes said it let her know she was not alone.  
>   
> “Just by knowing that I could put it in this box, my symptoms actually decreased overnight,” Prince-Hughes said.

The story as told in the article is compelling enough (dropped out of school at 15, spent the next 5 years homeless), I'm looking forward to reading the book.
