For parents of toddlers around 18 month old, few words are more disturbing than **[AUTISM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism)**. Unfortunately, more and more parents are hearing this word more and more often from their pediatricians. As recently as 30 years ago or less, 1 in 10,000 children were diagnosed with autism. Today, that number is 1 in 166. (You read it right - one in **one hundred sixty six** - two full orders of magnitude!)  
  
The obvious question that arises from this drastic increase: "Is this because more kids have autism, or are we just getting better at diagnosing it, or what?" The answer, I think, falls into the "or what" category.  
  
As way of background, I am the parent of an autistic son, Zeke, who is now 13 years old. Obviously, I have more than a passing interest in the current state of things in the world of autism, and there are many things to keep up with:

- the search for a cure
- nutritional / medical interventions
- school
- life after school

I've created this blog to help me sort through things for myself and to share what I find.
