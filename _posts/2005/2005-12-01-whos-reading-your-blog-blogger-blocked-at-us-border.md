It's hard to believe it has been almost three weeks since [BlawgThink](http://www.blawgthink.com) and I still haven't written anything about it!! Between the holidays blah blah blah. Most of my writing these days has been on my [autism blog](http://29marbles.blogspot.com), but I do have a lot of ideas in the works for here.  
  
A couple of weeks ago, I [wrote about](http://nsl.blogspot.com/2005/10/blog-usability-top-ten-mistakes.html) the [Top 10 Blog Usability mistakes](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/weblogs.html) according to [Jakob Nielsen](http://www.useit.com/). (I've made at least one change to my site design based on that list, only nine more to go ;-)  
  
The number nine top mistake is "forgetting that you are writing for your future boss." Sometimes, though, a future boss may be the least of your worries. I recently [wrote about this](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/11/whos-reading-your-blog-some-thoughts.html) on my aforementioned autism blog, [29 Marbles](http://29marbles.blogspot.com), and came across the [eweek](http://www.eweek.com) article [Blogger Blocked at U.S. Border](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1894227,00.asp) today:

> Bloggers have no privacy and should expect noneâ€”a lesson painfully learned by a Canadian citizen who was recently turned away after U.S. border guards Googled him and pored over his blog to discover where he lives.

Just a quick reminder that you are writing for ANYONE that may want to find out information about you in the future.
