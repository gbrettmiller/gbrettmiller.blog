In an [interview about his company BitTorrent](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10099449/site/newsweek/), CEO Bram Cohen had this to say about his Asperger's:

> **You've been open about being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. How has that affected you as a software author and as a CEO?**  
> It makes you less emotional when you're coding. It's like you don't take it personally when the computer doesn't work well. I'm still relatively new to the CEO thing, so ask me that question in a couple years.  
>   
> **What's the biggest misconception about Asperger's?**  
> That people with Asperger's are immoral, which isn't true at all. People with Asperger's frequently don't understand what's going on, and don't know how to express what they're thinking, but that's very different from not wanting to do the right thing.
