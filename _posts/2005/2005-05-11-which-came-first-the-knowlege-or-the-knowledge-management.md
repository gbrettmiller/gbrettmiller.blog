What is knowledge? What is knowledge management? (Uh oh, here we go again!) In a [recent post](http://jaarons.typepad.com/dubbings/2005/05/biting_our_own_.html), Jeremy has the following to say about trying to define knowledge:

> Part of the problem, I think, is that there really is no general agreement on what Knowledge Management actually is. And since one's definition of knowledge really depends upon one's definition of KM the knowledge question won't be adequately answered until the KM question is dealt with.

I read the statement twice, then read it again to make sure it said what I thought it said. And it did.  
  
If I had written the sentence above, I would likely have said "one's definition of knowledge management depends on one's definition of knowledge." Because, after all, how can you manage something if you don't know what that something is? (Chicken or the egg?)  
  
But it does get you thinking....

_Just an interesting note: my second post to this blog, back in June '03, was entitled **[What is Knowledge Management, anyway?](http://nsl.blogspot.com/2003/06/what-is-knowledge-management-anyway.html)**. Amazing to reflect on how much has been achieved and figured out in that time, but how we are still trying to figure out the answer to the basic question._
