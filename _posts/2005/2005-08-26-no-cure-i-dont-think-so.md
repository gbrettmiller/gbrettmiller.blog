Reading all the different descriptions in various news stories this week, I noticed that almost all of the stories stated, "There is no cure for autism" (or something very similar). What a downer. Talk about something that just drains your hope. **NO CURE**. That sucks.  
  
But I don't believe that's true. What these reports should be saying is, "There is no **known** cure." Sure it's still depressing, but at least there is room for hope for those parents and sufferers who are seeking a cure.
