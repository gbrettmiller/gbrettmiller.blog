[Jack Vinson](http://www.jackvinson.com) talks about teaching RSS, and points elsewhere, in [Teaching RSS](http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2005/11/29/teaching_rss.html):

> Marshall Kirkpatrick gives us a very nice discussion of what he does when teaching RSS to people. [Teaching RSS: A Discussion](http://marshallk.com/teaching-rss-a-discussion)
