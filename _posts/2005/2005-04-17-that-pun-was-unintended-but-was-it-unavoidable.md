Listening to a discussion on a talk radio show yesterday, one of the guests said something to the effect, "The US is a magnet for steel from everywhere else..., no pun intended." Which got me thinking.  
  
People make these unintended puns because their mind is already thinking of the subject, as in the reference to a magnet in a discussion of the steel industry. In the same way, our everyday decisions - whether personal, business, or something in between - are influenced by what we are already thinking of.  
  
I think we all want to believe that we make objective decisions based on just the information, but we need to keep in mind that all of our decisions are **subjective**, it's just that sometimes we don't know it.
