My lack of blogging this summer had nothing to do with a lack of things to write about. On the contrary, this summer was pretty much packed to over-flowing. The big event was moving from the Jersey shore back home to St. Louis (after a nearly 23 year absence) and all the little things that went into that. Thrown in for good measure was a major design review for the system I'm working on, a family vacation with friends as kind of a going away party, the [**USA Gymnastics**](http://www.usa-gymnastics.org/) [Trampoline and Tumbling National Championships](http://www.usa-gymnastics.org/tt/2005/champs/tt-natlresults/tramp5-7.html) (Top Ten finish!!!) in Houston, TX, and.... I think you get the idea.  
  
The move, and associated events, has given me a lot to write about from a KM and information technology (specifically the web) standpoint. Though I won't go into it all today, some of the things I'll write about from the move include:  

- The web and the future of real estate
- The web and finding services
- Shopping online
- Community and school research
- Getting settled in
- Starting up a home office

Basically some observations, lessons learned, and advice (or should I say "suggestions"?).
