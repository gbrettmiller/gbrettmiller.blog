When most people discuss Knowledge Management in organizations, they are mainly talking about managing the knowledge of the individuals in the workforce. It seems to me that from an organizational standpoint this is really nothing more than **information management**. I say that because the "knowledge" that a worker possesses, when put into the larger context of an organization, is simple information that the _**organization**_ uses to create knowledge, make decisions, etc.  
  
As knowledge in humans is the interconnectedness of information in neurons in the brain, so then is **Organizational knowledge** the _knowledge_ that the organization possesses as a result of the interconnectedness of the information in the _neurons_ - that is, the people - in the organization.
