I am rediscovering my love of Hofstadter's [_Gödel Escher Bach_](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567) (aka GEB) through a deep reading group on Clubhouse. This week was Chapter X, **Levels of Description**. Re-reading this prior to and with the room, I realized that my initial reading of this all those years ago (40?!?) was very likely the genesis of one of my key wonderings, [Layers of abstraction, the cost of convenience, and the commoditization of experience](https://gbrettmiller.blog/wonderings/layers-of-abstraction-the-cost-of-convenience-and-the-commoditization-of-experience/).

From chess, to management, to programming, chunking of information, fractals and the cost associated with learning and execution, this chapter covers a lot of ground. Hardware vs. software? Yep, that's in there as well.

Yeah, I love this book. And this deep reading group, and the people who are in it. And, for that matter, I'm really starting to appreciate [Clubhouse](https://joinclubhouse.com), even if their server does seem to get overloaded quite frequently.
