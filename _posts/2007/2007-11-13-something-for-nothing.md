As with religion, and I'm sure many other things, it is hard to discuss the concept of mastery in the abstract. To talk about religion you pretty much need to discuss it in the context of a specific denomination. Likewise, to discuss mastery it is easier, and more meaningful, to discuss it in the context of a specific activity or field of endeavor.

![](images/41GADYsMTAL._SL210_.jpg)Every now and then, though, I come across something that I think captures the spirit of the concept of mastery. And sometimes I rediscover something that I enjoyed a long time ago, and realize that the reason I enjoyed it so much is because it spoke to my interest in mastery.

Even though it is now nearly 30 years old, the [Rush](http://www.rush.com "RUSH") album [2112](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/B000001ESF/104-8031796-0304717 "aStore - Rush 2112") is still a classic. Aside from the epic title track, one of my favorite [Rush](http://www.rush.com "RUSH") songs has always been **Something For Nothing**. I hadn't heard it in a while (the iTunes shuffle mode hasn't come around to it recently), but hearing it last night (I had placed disc 3 of the [Different Stages: Live](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/B00000DGV2/104-8031796-0304717 "aStore - Rush Different Stages: Live") CD into the CD player) I realized why I enjoy it so much (aside from the great music!).

Here's a sampling of the lyrics by Neal Peart:

> Waiting for the winds of change To sweep the clouds away Waiting for the rainbow's end To cast its gold your way Countless ways You pass the days
> 
> Waiting for someone to call And turn your world around ...
> 
> You don't get something for nothing You can't have freedom for free **You won't get wise With the sleep still in your eyes No matter what your dreams might be**

Those last three lines pretty much say it all, don't they. It's good to have desires and goals, but you can't wait for someone else to give it to you. You have to go out and get it for yourself, and it may not be easy. (In other words: Execution is key.)

Of course, the rewards are worth it in the end as the lyrics, again, so eloquently capture:

> What you own is your own kingdom What you do is your own glory What you love is your own power What you live is your own story In your head is the answer Let it guide you along Let your heart be the anchor And the beat of your own song
