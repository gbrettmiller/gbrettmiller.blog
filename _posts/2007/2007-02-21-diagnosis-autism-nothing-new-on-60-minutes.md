A quick follow up to [29 Marbles: Autism on 60 Minutes - 18 Feb 07](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2007/02/autism-on-60-minutes-18-feb-07.html#links) . My first thoughts after watching the 60 Minutes piece [Diagnosis: Autism](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/15/60minutes/main2483414.shtml) on Sunday night was, "Wow, this was a non-event."  
  
Maybe it's just me, and the fact that over the past year I've been soaking in just about every autism story, theory, etc and reading several autism related books, but the show didn't seem to shed any new light on anything.  
  
Of course, if I were the parent of a recently diagnosed child, or (gasp) the parent of a 6-12 month old who wasn't responding when I called his name, it would have been a different story. But what exactly would I have learned?
