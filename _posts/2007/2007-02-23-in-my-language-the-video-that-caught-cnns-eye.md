The spark that caught CNN's eye about Amanda Baggs (see my [last post](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2007/02/why-dont-more-people-understand-this.html#links) if you don't know what I'm talking about) was her video "In My Language" posted on YouTube. While it is easy enough to just [go to YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnylM1hI2jc) to watch it, I would like to share it here as well.
