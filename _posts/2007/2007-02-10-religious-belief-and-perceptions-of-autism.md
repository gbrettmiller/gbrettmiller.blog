I just posted the following in the [comments](http://www2.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6900412&postID=8329975923468201161&isPopup=true) to my [last post](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2007/02/power-of-pop-culture.html), in response to a comment from [jypsy](http://irunman.blogspot.com/), but wasn't sure how many people would see it there. So, here it is again.  
  
I would be curious to see if there is any data concerning the effect of religious belief on how someone views autism (and vice versa). Are devoutly religious people more likely to consider autism a 'bad thing' that should be overcome (ie, curebies)? Are atheists more likely to accept autism as a part of global neurodiversity?  
  
Or is the issue, like most everything else, more complex than those simple distinctions. (I'm sure the answer to that is yes.)  
  
Has anyone seen any data on that?
