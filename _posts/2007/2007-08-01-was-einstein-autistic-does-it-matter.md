When I started reading Walter Isaacson's new biography of Albert Einstein, one of the first things I did was look in the index to see if autism or Asperger's was listed. No on both counts.  
  
As I've read the book, I've found myself unconsciously evaluating the information presented through a diagnostic lens, trying to decide if he was indeed autistic. (See this [Google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=einstein+autism+autistic) for a lot of discussion about the topic.)  
  
I'll post my thoughts on the matter after I've finished the book and had the chance to digest it all, but in the meantime the following question came to mind:  

> Does it really matter if Einstein were autistic or not?
