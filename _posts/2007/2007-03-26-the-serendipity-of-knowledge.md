![Album Cover - Liquid Tension Experiment](images/B0000067YK.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_SL210_.jpg "Album Cover - Liquid Tension Experiment")A month or so ago in a [discussion about the value of blogs and wikis as collaboration tools](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/2007/02/huberts_error.php "Cognitive Edge:  Hubert's error"), Dave Snowden stated, "Knowledge discovery is serendipitous, not planned." Last weekend, I had a 'no-tech' version of this experience at [Mozingo Music](http://www.mozingomusic.com/ "Mozingo Music") in Ellisville, where I had taken my son to pick up some new sticks and mallets (he is a percussionist).

While Ian was looking through the different options, my eyes were drawn to the shelf of instructional DVDs. One in particular caught my eye, [Mike Portnoy](http://www.mikeportnoy.com/ "Mike Portnoy.com - The Official Website")'s [Liquid Drum Theater](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/B00005RYOX/105-0704870-6814832 "amazon:  Mike Portnoy - Liquid Drum Theater"). Though I didn't buy the DVD, the info on the jacket made me want to learn more about Portnoy's music with various groups. The group that stuck in my mind was [Liquid Tension Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Tension_Experiment "wikipedia:  Liquid Tension Experiment") (with such a cool name, how could it not).

I'm always on the prowl for good new music, preferably good instrumental rock, and what I found with Liquid Tension Experiment on their two, aptly titled, CDs - [Liquid Tension Experiment](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/B0000067YK/105-0704870-6814832 "amazon:  Liquid Tension Experiment") and [Liquid Tension Experiment 2](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/B00000J7UT/105-0704870-6814832 "amazon:  Liquid Tension Experiment 2") - didn't disappoint me. After listening to a couple of 30 second excerpts on the iTunes store, these two albums very quickly made their way into my collection of songs. (I'd have provided links to the albums in the iTunes store, but I'm not sure you can actually do that in a browser.)

To say that these guys are good would be a gross understatement, so I was anxious to see what else they had put out. Turns out that Liquid Tension Experiment was kind of a 'side-gig' for Portnoy and others, so they only released the two CDs mentioned above. As an 'experiment,' I would say that they definitely succeeded.

If you don't want to buy both full albums but want to get a good sample of what they've got to offer, I'd recommend Paradigm Shift or Freedom of Speech from the first album, and Acid Rain or Biaxident from the second. You'll be glad you did.
