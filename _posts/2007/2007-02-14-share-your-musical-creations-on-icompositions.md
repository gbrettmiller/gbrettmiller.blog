Like many others, I have been making use of [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) to post pictures and video. In fact, part of my recent new layout of this site was to allow me to post links to those sites. Over the Christmas break, I discovered a new site to share my digital music creations: [iCompositions](http://www.icompositions.com "iCompositions.com - Empowering the Independent Musician").

So far, I've posted 4 songs, which you can listen to from my artist page. One was done in [Apple](http://www.apple.com "Apple")'s [Soundtrack](http://www.apple.com/finalcutexpress/soundtrack.html "Apple - Final Cut Express HD - Soundtrack") application (which came with [Final Cut Express](http://www.apple.com/finalcutexpress/ "Apple - Final Cut Express HD")), the others in [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/ "Apple - iLife - GarageBand") (part of the Apple [iLife](http://www.apple.com/ilife "Apple - iLife") suite of apps), all exclusively using Apple Loops - I've not quite made it to the point of recording any original material.

Most of the songs I've put together have been in the context of video scores. I'm working my way up to songs I think can stand on their own. Like many of the social sharing sites, iCompositions has a large community of people who are more than happy to help you as you learn and to provide comments and criticism that will help you improve.

iCompositions is also a great place to find new music from a large collection of independent musicians in a wide variety of genres. Something for everyone's taste. Quite a few of the songs I've found there have made their way onto my iPod (like [makpiano88](http://www.icompositions.com/artists/makpiano88)'s [Awakening](http://www.icompositions.com/artists/makpiano88 "Awakening by makpiano88 | iCompositions")).
