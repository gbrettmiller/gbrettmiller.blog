Mike? Hmm, that's a new person leaving comments. Good comments. I wonder what his blog looks like. [Action For Autism](http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/), nice name. Wow, this is good stuff. He's been blogging for how long, over a year? Over 27,000 hits? And he's written some autism books? Have I been sleeping, or what?  
  
That was my train of thought as I, well you can tell what I was doing.  
  
It never ceases to amaze me that there is so much good stuff out there on autism, and I am continually frustrated that I'll never be able to find it all (and even if I did I'd never get to read it all).  
  
If you've not seen Mike Stanton's blog Action for Autism, do yourself a favor and check it out.
