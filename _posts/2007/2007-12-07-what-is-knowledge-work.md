The question of how a [knowledge worker learns how to be a knowledge worker](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/how-do-knowledge-workers-especially-new-ones-learn-how-to-be-knowledge-workers "NSL:  How do knowledge workers, especially new ones, learn to become knowledge workers") begs the question, "**What is knowledge work**?" Lilia Efimova has some thoughts on this in her post [Knowledge Work Framework (PKM + Tasks)](http://blog.mathemagenic.com/2007/12/03.html#a1961 "Mathemagenic:  Knowledge Work Framework"). Here's her diagram showing the framework, I encourage you to read her description.

I have the feeling I'll be revisiting this model quite a bit in the future.
