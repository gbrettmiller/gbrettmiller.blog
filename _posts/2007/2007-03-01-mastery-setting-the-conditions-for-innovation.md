Achieving mastery in your field of choice allows you to see and understand connections from outside your own area of expertise. I can't help thinking of Richard Feynmann's excursions outside the world of physics as an example. The recent [Science Daily](http://www.sciencedaily.com "Science Daily") story [Mathematicians Unlock Major Number Theory Puzzle](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070227121408.htm) provides another (emphasis mine):

> It was during a flight to New Hampshire that Ono realized the full depth and meaning of Zwegers' work. Skimming a journal to pass the time, Ono **happened upon** an old article by George Andrews on mock theta functions. **Suddenly**, he noticed that some of the mathematics in the paper seemed to resonate with parts of the Harmonic Maass theory, which he and Bringmann **just happened to be** developing at the time, for other reasons.

Or, as [Louis Pasteur](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur "Louis Pasteur - Wikiquote") said way back in 1854, chance (and [aha!) favors the prepared mind](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-04/afps-aft040506.php "Eureka Alert:  Aha! Favors the prepared mind ").
