I've long had the thought that Knowledge Management is akin to the sub-conscious of an organization, but was never quite happy with the analogy. [Malcolm Gladwell](http://www.gladwell.com)'s latest book [Blink](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316172324/gbrettmiller-20) discusses the concept of "adaptive unconscious" and how it affects us as individuals.  
  
I can't help but think that a similar process is at work in organizations. More to follow....
