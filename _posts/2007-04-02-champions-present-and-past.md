If you would like to see a bit of current World Series Champion history, the [World Championship Trophy will be on display](http://www.mohistory.org/content/membershipservices/enewsletterapr07.html#7 "MHS Members eNewsletter:  World Championship Trophy on Display") at the Missouri Historical Society (Missouri History Museum) in [Forest Park here in St. Louis](http://www.mohistory.org/content/TravelInfo/travelinfo.aspx "MHS:  Travel Info") beginning this Saturday. Society members will get a chance to see it Saturday morning before it is open to the general public , so now may be a good time to become a member. The 30 pound, sterling silver trophy will be on view in the museumâ€™s MacDermott Grand Hall 7 April - 13 May 2007 (except for 23-25 April, when the trophy will not be on display).

A bit of interesting trivia, thanks to the folks at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series_Trophy "World Series Trophy:  wikipedia"): The trophy, officially called the Commissioner's Trophy, was first presented in 1967 to the **St. Louis Cardinals (!)** following their victory over the Boston Red Sox.

Speaking of baseball, yesterday was a beautiful day for it, and a great day for opening day ceremonies for the reigning World Series Champion [Cardinals](http://www.stlouiscardinals.com "The Official Site of the St. Louis Cardinals"). In addition to the current champions and new additions to Busch stadium to honor them, the festivities included quite a few champions from the Cardinal's past.

> After the [Budweiser Clydesdales](http://www.grantsfarm.com/ClydesdaleStables.htm "Grant's Farm:  Clydesdale Stables") got the party started, parading around the field, Cardinals radio voice John Rooney and actor Billy Bob Thornton took over as the official emcees of the evening festivities.
> 
> Shortly after each member of the team took a trip around the field in a convertible, past Cardinals greats were introduced, commemorating St. Louis' last two World Series championships, in 1967 and '82.
> 
> Some of the former players on hand were Keith Hernandez, Joaquin Andujar, Bob Forsch and Bruce Sutter from the '82 championship squad. Representing the '67 championship team were Tim McCarver, Red Schoendienst, Lou Brock and Bob Gibson, among others.
> 
> [![OpeningDay07](images/shjj4tgu.jpg "OpeningDay07")](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gallery/index.jsp "St. Louis Cardinals:  Photo Gallery")The pregame festivities continued when Adam Wainwright, Gibson and Sutter threw out the ceremonial first pitches. Those were the three pitchers to record the final out for the Cardinals' last three World Series titles. The three hurlers threw to the managers that led them to the World Series: Tony La Russa, Schoendienst and Whitey Herzog.
> 
> Sutter joked before the toss that he didn't know if he could get it to Herzog, and if he did, he didn't know if Herzog could catch it. Sutter had no problem delivering a strike to his former manager.
> 
> All in all, it was quite a day for Cardinals fans, who waited 24 years in between for their World Series titles. Some fans were so eager for the first game that they went to downtown St. Louis several days early.

Pretty much a perfect opening day. Except, of course, that the [Cardinals lost to the Mets](http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20070401&content_id=1873994&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=stl "Carpenter, Cards stifled in opener").
