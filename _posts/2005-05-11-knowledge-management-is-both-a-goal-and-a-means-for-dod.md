The May '05 issue of [Signal Magazine](http://www.afcea.org/signal/) from the [Armed Forces Communications Electronics Association (AFCEA)](http://www.afcea.org) has a large section addressing the role of knowledge management in today's Department of Defense. The articles range from discussions of technology used to create a "net-centric" force to descriptions of ongoing research into the cognitive workings of teams (that one is my favorite).  
  
If nothing else, the article provides a glimpse at the challenges faced by military forces in collecting, processing, distributing, and using information and knowledge, both from a technical perspective and a "people" perspective. Check it out when you have a chance.
