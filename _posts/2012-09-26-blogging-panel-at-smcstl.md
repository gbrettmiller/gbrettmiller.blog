On Monday (24 September), the [Social Media Club St. Louis](http://www.smcstl.com "If you get it, share it") ([@SMCSTL](http://twitter.com/smcstl)) hosted a panel of bloggers to discuss, what else, blogging. It has been many years since I first started blogging and the reasons and results of blogging, not to mention the tools, have evolved quite a bit. The panel shared some great insights into what motivates them to blog, and what they get out of blogging.  

SMCSTL did a great job of putting a diverse group of bloggers together, including four distinct type of bloggers:

- Melanie Bernds ([@DanforthCenter](http://twitter.com/DanforthCenter)) blogs [as an employee](http://www.danforthcenter.org/wordpress/?page_id=10 "Danforth Center - Roots & Shoots")
- Matt Homann ([@MattHomann](http://twitter.com/MattHomann)) blogs in [support of his own business](http://www.nonbillablehour.com/ "the [non]billable hour")
- Danyelle Little ([@TheCubicleChick](http://twitter.com/TheCubicleChick)) blogs [for a living](http://www.thecubiclechick.com/ "Work. Life. Play. Lifestyle blog for fabulous cubes")
- Stephanie Shepard ([@OffEatenPathSTL](http://twitter.com/OffEatenPathSTL)) blogs [for passion](http://offtheeatenpathstl.com/ "Exploring St. Louis, one meal at a time...")

I was going to write a bit more about the conversation, but Allison Babka ([@AMBabka](http://twitter.com/AMBabka "Freelance writer/producer/social sparkplug.")) did a better job than I could have ever hoped to do in her [storification of the night](http://storify.com/ambabka/smcstl-blogging-panel-9-25-12 "Social Media Club St. Louis organized a varied panel of noted local bloggers - @DanforthCenter, @MattHomann, @TheCubicleChick, @OffEatenPathSTL - to share tips about blogging, content creation and scheduling, analytics and personal pride. @NickGilham moderated.").
