A lot has been happening over the past couple of weeks, quite a few things I want to write about and ideas to explore. It's just been a very busy couple of weeks, and all of my writing (and coding and much of my thinking) has been aimed at my day job. You know, the one that pays the bills.

Here's a list of drafts I've created in the past two weeks or so that I'm working on in bits and pieces and will hopefully start pushing out in the next couple of days. Or maybe over the Christmas slowdown. ("Christmas slowdown"? Yeah, that'll happen :)

- Layers of abstraction and the cost of convenience
- Passion and Warfare in St. Louis - an evening with Steve Vai
- If everyone gave him $20
- From Android to iPhone
- Some notes and thoughts on WordCampUS 2017
- Accidents of Phenotype
- The work of art (as opposed to "a work of art")

And one I haven't started yet that I've had in the back of my mind for years and was brought to the front earlier tonight, that will likely be called **What Capital Wants**  (see [Capitalism is Skynet](http://gbrettmiller.com/2016/12/15/capitalism-is-skynet/) for a hint what that might be about).

But right now I need to put together some notes on a proposed talk about crowdsourcing innovation for [JiveWorld 2017](https://jiveworld.jivesoftware.com/).
