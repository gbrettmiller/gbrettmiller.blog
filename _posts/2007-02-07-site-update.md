If you read this blog exclusively through an RSS reader, you probably haven't seen my site theme updates. I'm using the same basic theme, just added an extra column to provide a bit more useful/entertaining/productive content for those who do visit the site. If you get a chance, please check it out and let me know what you think.

In addition to the standard stuff (categories, archives, etc.), I've added a bit more personal links. These include a "Creation" group, with links to other online content I've created or contributed to, and a "Consumption" group, to share some of my recent finds. I'm still working the "Consumption" group out, trying to figure out the best way to present it. In addition to the 'monetized' items like books and CD/DVD referrals, I plan to include links to blogs I frequent.

Speaking of monetization (is that really a word?), I've also added a section for straight out "Capitalism" which includes (of course) Google Ads as well as various other affiliate / referral programs. Still working out the kinks on this one as well, so feel free to let me know how I can make it better. (And - by all means - please follow the links and buy something ;-) )
