[![](images/stem-cell-harvest.jpg "stem cell harvest")](http://healthcare.zdnet.com/?p=629)I was catching up on some news this evening, reading about [stem cells here in Missouri](http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/sciencemedicine/story/2FA34FEDA1A070CB86257575000F4F38?OpenDocument), with iTunes on shuffle, as usual. About half way through the article, [Dream Theater](http://www.dreamtheater.net)'s song [The Great Debate](http://www.darklyrics.com/lyrics/dreamtheater/sixdegreesofinnerturbulence.html#4) (from [Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Inner_Turbulence)) came on. I had to stop and listen.

If you know the song, you know that it is a discussion about then-President Bush's decision concerning stem cells back in 2001. Here's what [wikipedia has to say](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Debate_(song)) about the song:

> "**The Great Debate**" is an innovative song by the progressive metal band [Dream Theater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater "Dream Theater") dealing with the topic of [stem cell research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_research "Stem cell research"). It opens with various sound bytes of individuals' beliefs and opinions concerning this contentious topic. Both sides of this debate are represented lyrically, and the band challenges the listener repeatedly with the chorus phrase- "Are you justified in taking life to save life?" and "Do we look to our Unearthly Guide?...or to white coat heroes, searching for a cure?"

What really struck me is how little seems to have changed in the last 7 1/2 years.  Consider these verses from the song:

> What if someone said Promise lies ahead Hopes are high in certain scientific circles Life won't have to end You could walk again
> 
> What if someone said Problems lie ahead They've uncovered something highly controversial The right to life is strong Can't you see it's wrong

Or, as they say toward the end of the song, **miracle potential** vs. **the sanctity of life**. Much the same as what is being said this week.

The stem cell debate reminds me quite a bit of another great debate:  [vaccines and autism](http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&ned=us&hl=en&q=autism+vaccine).  Though the substance of the two debates is different, they are qualitatively very similar: no matter what evidence or arguments are presented, it is very unlikely that you will ever change the opinion of someone who actually has an opinion.
