When I first discovered the [Cynefin framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cynefin), I remember thinking, "Exactly." It is one of those things that once I saw it I realized how obvious it was, at least in hindsight after someone had pointed it out. Of course, I've been trying to actually figure it out ever since.

[Dave Snowden blogged recently](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/2010/02/evolution_of_cynefin_over_a_de.php) that he is putting together a history of Cynefin, and provides a brief timeline of its origins and where it is now. He also includes a diagram showing the diagram as it was in 2000 compared to what it is now.

My most [recent post that included Cynefin](https://gbrettmiller.blog/cynefin-concept-work-and-the-role-of-deliberate-practice/) looked at it in the context of  concept work and the role of [deliberate practice](https://gbrettmiller.blog/tag/deliberatepractice/) in achieving [mastery](https://gbrettmiller.blog/category/mastery/). The basic premise of that post was that success in the chaotic domain requires mastery, which is the result of a lot (10,000 + hours) of deliberate practice. Even though originally developed with a focus on knowledge management and communities of practice, the origins of the model, as shown above, seem to lend some validity to my understanding.

An added bonus to Dave's blog post is the comment from [Steve Barth](http://reflexions.typepad.com/) (the emphasis is mine):

> Something I’ve been thinking about lately relates to the original knowledge-training axis in the early drawings. It comes up working with clients to differentiate and merge knowledge management and organizational learning programs. Increasingly, I believe tha**t knowledge and learning are often polar opposites**, and the order/unorder sides of the model make this clear. **Simple and complicated** **emphasize what we** _**already know**_—or at least believe to be true—and further investigations and analysis must either accept or falsify these premises. We assume that our assumptions are correct. On the other hand, **learning is largely about what we** _**don’t know**_. That is, we must assume that our assumptions could be wrong.

I'm looking forward to the full history.
