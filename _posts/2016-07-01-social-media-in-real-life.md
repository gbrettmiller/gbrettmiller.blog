Last night I attended the Social Media Club - St. Louis ([@smcstl](https://twitter.com/SMCSTL)) happy hour in celebration of [Social Media Day](http://mashable.com/smday/). The event was held at [Filament](http://www.thefilament.com/), an incredible new meeting and conference space in downtown St. Louis from my friend [Matt Homann](https://twitter.com/matthomann) and his partners. The team went all out to create a fun evening while showcasing the talent and approach of the Filament team and their process.

The main gathering space was where most of the conversation happened, and good conversation it was. Putting a bit of twist on the typical SMCSTL member engagement on social media during an event, where people are encouraged - expected, even - to be engaged with their gadgets and online networks, the side rooms were each converted into an "offline" version of a social media tool.

In the LinkedIn room, you were asked to post your resume in haiku-ish fashion; three lines of 5, 7, and 5 words. (You can see mine at [Resume in haiku(ish)](http://gbrettmiller.com/2016/07/01/resume-in-haikuish/).)  The Instagram room had a wall where you could post your hand-drawn selfie, such as this one by [Jessica](https://twitter.com/jesshomann/status/748673862934597635). And, of course, the Facebook room had a wall where you could post and share.

If you live in St. Louis and are at all interested or involved in social media, you really should check out the [Social Media Club - St. Louis](https://www.facebook.com/smcstl) Chapter.

And if you live anywhere and are looking for an incredible place to hold your next meeting, conference, retreat, off-site, whatever, definitely check out [Filament](http://www.thefilament.com). Because if you absolutely need to have that meeting, you might as well [**do it right**](http://www.thefilament.com/methods/).
