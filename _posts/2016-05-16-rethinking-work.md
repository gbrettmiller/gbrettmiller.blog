Another interesting hour from [To The Best of Our Knowledge](http://ttbook.org).

[**Rethinking Work**](http://www.ttbook.org/book/rethinking-work) -

> American companies generate a lot of wealth. But Americans aren't seeing much of it. Media theorist Douglas Rushkoff says that's because today's corporations are obsessed with one thing -- growth. We'll find out why our economy's operating system is broken and how we can fix it, as we rethink work. Also, we'll explore the six-hour work day and the case for a universal basic income.

I've recently completed Rushkoff's [Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus](http://www.amazon.com/Throwing-Rocks-Google-Bus-Prosperity/dp/1617230170%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJWAGHMYTPK5725MQ%26tag%3Dwiscpublradi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1617230170) (highly recommended) and Dan Lyons' [Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble](http://www.amazon.com/Disrupted-My-Misadventure-Start-Up-Bubble/dp/0316306088%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJWAGHMYTPK5725MQ%26tag%3Dwiscpublradi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0316306088) is towards the top of my to-read list.

I have been thinking lately about Universal Basic Income, and the interview here with Rutger Bregman has some useful insights. (Which means I'll need to read his [Utopia for Realists: The Case for a Universal Basic Income, Open Borders, and a 15-Hour Workweek](http://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Realists-Universal-Borders-Workweek/dp/9082520303%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJWAGHMYTPK5725MQ%26tag%3Dwiscpublradi-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D9082520303) soon, too.)

The phrase that really jumped out at me, and which will likely become the title of a future blog post, was that "UBI is the dividend of progress". Ties in nicely with my musings a few years back on the idea, [If the government were run like a business…](http://gbrettmiller.com/2012/09/27/if-the-government-were-run-like-a-business/)
