Â 

Though I haven't used [Facebook at Work](https://www.facebook.com/facebookatwork) (yet), this is very similar to what we provide inside the firewall using [Jive](https://www.jivesoftware.com) as the cornerstone of an Enterprise Social Network. So much better than email, and yet so difficult to get people to understand and use.
