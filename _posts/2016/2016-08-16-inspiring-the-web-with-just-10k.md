My friends and coworkers know I complain (a lot) about how bloated things have become and how I pine for the good old days when page downloads were measured in tens of kilobytes instead of megabytes. Time to put my mind to work coming up with a solution instead of just complaining.

"With so much of an emphasis on front-end frameworks and JavaScript runtimes, it’s time to get back to basics—back to optimizing every little byte like your life depends on it and ensuring your site can work, no matter what. The Challenge? Build a compelling web experience that can be delivered in 10kB and works without JavaScript."
