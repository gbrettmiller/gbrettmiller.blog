[This neuroscientist is figuring out how to harness the enormous potential of the unconscious mind](http://www.sciencealert.com/discover-the-power-of-the-unconscious-part-of-your-brain)

> We often react to a certain image or a certain word on a deeper level without having to engage the conscious parts of our brain, and it's this kind of 'power' Eagleman is talking about in his research. It's still at an early, unpublished stage, but it promises to uncover more about what goes on below the surface of our minds.

Have to admit, I thought much of this had already been hashed out before. Of course the subconscious (unconscious) mind plays a key part in our lives, more so than even the conscious mind.
