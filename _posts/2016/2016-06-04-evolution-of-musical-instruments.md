Â 

Musical instrument and portable recording studio in a 10" (or so) package. All you need is a little electricity to charge the battery and a wee bit of talent. And this is just a tiny sample of what is possible. I can only imagine the awesomeness being unleashed out there. I can only hope that it will someday make it to my ears.
