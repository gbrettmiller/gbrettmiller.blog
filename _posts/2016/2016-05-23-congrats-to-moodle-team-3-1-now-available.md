Congrats to the [Moodle](https://moodle.org) team and everyone involved in the [Moodle 3.1 release](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_3.1_release_notes), including an update to [Moodle Mobile](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=333519#p1343473). From the [announcement](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=333515):

> Moodle 3.1 wraps a lot of new features together with hundreds of fixes and improvements into a package that we'll be supporting for the [next three years](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Releases), 1.5 years longer than most releases.
> 
> I am proud to announce that the most important new feature in this release is the new core support for [competencies](https://docs.moodle.org/31/en/Competencies), which is something we've been talking about and developing in the community for many years.  These help when Moodle is used for competency-based education (CBE), "mastery learning" and any technique that involves learning plans based on the things students know, and the things they are yet to know.
