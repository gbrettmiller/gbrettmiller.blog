A month or so ago I came across the word "tranche" in an article (or story or something). I consider myself well read with a decent sized vocabulary, but don't recall ever having seen that particular word before that article. (Yes, I had to look it up.)

Since then I've seen or heard the word used once or twice a week in varying contexts. Wondering how I missed it all those years, and why it has suddenly started showing up everywhere.

Is it just me?
