I first mentioned this tweet from [@codinghorror](https://twitter.com/codinghorror) in my [review of StrangeLoop 2010](https://gbrettmiller.com/2010/11/03/safe-no-awesome-yes-my-review-of-strange-loop-2010/).

It has stuck with me through the years, and always seems to pop up when it's needed. Not too long ago (wow - the better part of a year), I tweeted my own variation on this, exploring a bit the "is such crap" part of Jeff's tweet.

Is safe better than sorry?

It all depends on the context. How you define "safe" and "sorry", the time scale in which you're working. What you are willing to give up for what you want to achieve. What you are willing to tolerate. What you want to have written across your tombstone, or in the history books, when your time on this earth inevitably ends.
