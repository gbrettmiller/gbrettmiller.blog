"For me, this is an example of the role of the manager. I was not the _leader_ because the idea to form a circle in the middle was not mine. I was not a _coach_ because I didn’t help any person with their contribution. And I was not a _director_ because I didn’t provide any specific rules or instructions.

Instead, I just observed the system and I intervened by announcing that it wasn’t doing its job well. I then let the system work out the details."
