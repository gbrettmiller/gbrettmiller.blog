I first came across the idea of making work visible in [Jim McGee](http://mcgeesmusings.net/)'s 2002 blog post [Knowledge work as craft work](http://www.mcgeesmusings.net/stories/2002/03/21/KnowledgeWorkAsCraft.html), and the idea of "working out loud" in [Bryce Williams](https://thebryceswrite.com/about/)' blog post [When will we Work Out Loud? Soon!](https://thebryceswrite.com/2010/11/29/when-will-we-work-out-loud-soon/) I have used both as guides not only in how I get my own work done but in helping others understand how to get the most out of Enterprise Social Networks.

Author [John Stepper](http://workingoutloud.com/about/) developed these ideas further in his 2014 blog post, [The 5 elements of working out loud](http://workingoutloud.com/blog/the-5-elements-of-working-out-loud), and even further in his recent book, [Working Out Loud: For a better career and life](https://www.milsuite.mil/book/recommendedbooks/2095).  I have a feeling this book will join those other posts as guides to how I get work done. 

I encourage you to read the book, and to keep up with John over at his website. If you're not convinced by this brief testimonial, check out John's [recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpjNl3Z10uc) at TEDx Navesink.
