Caught the tail end of a story on NPR about naming the newly discovered Planet 9 where someone stated, "The naming of something as important as a planet should be done by society as a whole, not a couple of guys in California drinking coffee." My first thought was, as long as it has the name of a Roman god who really cares. But then I thought, "Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde."
