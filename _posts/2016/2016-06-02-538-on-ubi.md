Another quote / link on basic income, this one from FiveThirtyEight. A long article, worth the read. It's not just about today's poor, but tomorrow's (robot induced) unemployed too.

> Increasingly, technologists envision basic income as a “hack,” or fix, to the system — it offers a way of coping with an economic future dominated by automation, a fallback plan for when most human labor isn’t valued or needed.
> 
> “We think there could be a possibility where 95 percent — or a vast majority — of people won’t be able to contribute to the workforce,” said Matt Krisiloff, the manager of Y Combinator’s basic income project. “We need to start preparing for that transformation.”
