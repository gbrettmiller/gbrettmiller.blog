> I do think that women could make politics irrelevant; by a kind of spontaneous cooperative action the like of which we have never seen; which is so far from people’s ideas of state structure or viable social structure that it seems to them like total anarchy — when what it really is, is very subtle forms of interrelation that do not follow some heirarchal pattern which is fundamentally patriarchal. The opposite to patriarchy is not matriarchy but fraternity, yet I think it’s women who are going to have to break this spiral of power and find the trick of cooperation.

I first heard this quote when [Sinéad O'Connor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_O%27Connor) used it as the first track, an intro of sorts, to her 1994 album [**Universal Mother**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Mother). (Maybe my favorite album of hers, we saw her at the Paramount Theater in Asbury Park on the tour, great show.) The quote has stuck with me over the years and pops its head up at various times. Like now.

In one of those stereotypical "I wasn't thinking of anything and it just popped into my head" moments, the phrase "**the opposite to patriarchy is ... fraternity**" and [Jon Husband](http://wirearchy.com/)'s  concept of [wirearchy](http://wirearchy.com/what-is-wirearchy/) came together and presented themselves to my conscious mind. Obviously the full quote refers to political, not business, organization and is from "one of the major voices of the second-wave feminist movement in the latter half of the 20th century" about the role of women in the transformation of politics, and this reference to fraternity has nothing directly to do with business or the organization of work.

But I can't help thinking there is something here to explore.
