Could you live without your e-mail for a day? That's the question posed by Eric Mack in [More productive with\[out\] e-mail?](http://www.ericmackonline.com/emo/emonline.nsf/dx/more-productive-without-e-mail) After a brief history of e-mail's climb to the top, Eric points to **[They've got less mail](http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2004/08/27/theyve_got_less_mail_.html)**, a _Fast Company_ article about the Veritas Software marketing department making Friday a "no e-mail day".

> On Fridays, it's half that many. Now his employees talk face to face. Or they pick up the phone. They're more productive on days like today because there's less miscommunication and less time spent crafting notes just so.

Has e-mail become a productivity drain? Based on the way it is used in most organizations today, I would say YES. Does it have to be that way?  
  
NOPE.
