[Parents of the Autistic Weigh Lifelong Care Options](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9496250) on this morning's Morning Edition on NPR discusses many of the things that I've discussed here before: the need for [estate planning and trusts](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2006/02/planning-for-future-special-needs.html), thoughts on [how your adult child will live](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2006/03/whos-life-is-it-anyway-thoughts-on.html), potential [interactions with law enforcement](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2006/04/avoiding-unfortunate-situations-autism.html).  
  
What struck me the most about the story, though, was how autism was portrayed and - more importantly - how the parents in the story have responded to life with autism. The quote I used for the title of this post - "It's an odd life, but a good one" - pretty much sums it up.  
  
Finally, a story about autism in the national media that doesn't focus on the doom-and-gloom, woe-is-me (I?), "my child is gone" view of autism that is so prevalent in the media today. Could this be the start of a new trend?  
  
Let's hope so.
