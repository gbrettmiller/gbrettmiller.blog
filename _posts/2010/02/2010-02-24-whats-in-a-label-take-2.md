In my [last posting](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/whats-in-a-label-autism-aspergers-and-the-dsm-v/), I wrote the following about the consolidation of Asperger's Disorder and PDD-NOS into a single classification for Autism Spectrum Disorder:

> My experience leads me to believe that many people donâ€™t understand the concept of a spectrum unless they can clearly see the boundaries between the different layers of the spectrum.

This generated some interesting conversations that have helped me as I figure out what I think.

Of course, the problem I had with combining these separate diagnoses into a single one - that people would tend to see all autistics as "the same" - also exists with the more "specific" diagnoses. It's just that now you've got several variations on the theme: all Asperger's is the same, all PDD-NOS is the same, all Autism is the same.

Thinking about all this reminded me of the expression "If you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism." We are making a lot of process in getting this message out, and identifying autism as a spectrum could help with this even more.
