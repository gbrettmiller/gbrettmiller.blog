If autism could be cured, and if we, as a society, chose to cure it, what would that mean for our future?

How would it impact our lives, and the lives of our children (and descendants many generations down the line)?

What would society look like 50 years from now?Â 100 years from now, when autism (or autism-like traits) were no longer a part of our world?
