I read - and highly recommend - Garry Kasparov's book [How Life Imitates Chess](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596913878?ie=UTF8&tag=nostraightlines-20&link_code=wql&camp=212361&creative=380601) a couple of years ago, and am thinking I should pick it back up again. If not to read in its entirety, then at least to skim through my dog-ears and margin notes. There are a lot of good insights into the nature of work today, especially what we call knowledge-work.

For example, Jack Vinson's ([@jackvinson](http://twitter.com/jackvinson)) recent post [Some qualities of a knowledge worker](http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2010/09/21/some_qualities_of_a_knowledge_worker.html) reminded me of the following excerpt:

> Knowing a solution is at hand is a huge advantage; it’s like not having a “none of the above” option. Anyone with reasonable competence and adequate resources can solve a puzzle when it is presented as something to be solved. We can skip the subtle evaluations and move directly to plugging in possible solutions until we hit upon a promising one. Uncertainty is far more challenging. Instead of immediately looking for solutions to the crisis, we have to maintain a constant state of asking, “Is there a crisis\* forming?”

Solving a puzzle that you know has a solution may require knowledge, but it is knowledge that already exists. Figuring out if there is a solution to a problem, or even if there is a problem at all, requires the manipulation of existing knowledge, the gathering of new knowledge / information, and the creation of something new.

This is when knowledge work becomes art.
