In his post [Some qualities of a knowledge worker](http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2010/09/21/some_qualities_of_a_knowledge_worker.html), which I also [mentioned yesterday](https://gbrettmiller.blog/2010/09/29/for-knowledge-workers-solving-problems-is-the-easy-part/), Jack Vinson ([@jackvinson](http://twitter.com/jackvinson)) mentioned a few skills needed by knowledge workers and notes

> These are things that aren't part of the standard training curriculum.  Maybe these things should be in the next generation of "life skills" classes they teach in high school.

**This gets right at the heart of a question I've pondered for several years: How do knowledge workers learn how to become knowledge workers?**

Is "knowledge work" something that should be taught in school, in high school as Jack mentions or maybe in college? Or is this something that individual workers need to learn on the job, as part of their professional growth, as part of their development of their craft?

Schools are, for the most part, set up for you to learn the skills/knowledge that you need (or they think you will need) to do your job. But they don't really teach you how to actually do the job. (It's been a while since I've been an undergrad, so maybe this has changed somewhat?) I think, though, that with a little bit of thought and a lot of effort these skills could be incorporated into a schools curriculum, either formally or informally by individual teachers. [The case for social media in school](http://mashable.com/2010/09/29/social-media-in-school/) provides some good ideas on this front.

The other approach is to look at knowledge work as a craft. Obviously, "knowledge work" is much too general of a description to be a craft in and of itself _\[_[_my dad is a knowledge worker_](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/some-new-thoughts-on-my-dad-is-a-knowledge-worker/)_!\]_. But just like the trades - plumbing, carpentry, electrician - you can look at the various forms of knowledge work as a craft - accountant, engineer, lawyer, software developer.

If the idea of knowledge work as craft sounds familiar, it’s not because of me. I first remember coming across that idea several years ago in Jim McGee’s ([@jmcgee](http://twitter.com/jmcgee)) [Knowledge Work as Craft Work](http://www.mcgeesmusings.net/stories/2002/03/21/KnowledgeWorkAsCraft.html "Jim McGee - Knowledge work as craft work").

> All along the way in this old style process, the work was visible. That meant that the more junior members of the team could learn how the process unfolded and how the final product grew over time. You, as a consultant, could see how the different editors and commentators reacted to different parts of the product.

More recently, Jim has written about this in the context of [observable work](http://www.mcgeesmusings.net/tag/observable-work/) ([#owork](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23owork)). His recent post [Finding knowledge work practices worth emulating and adapting](http://www.mcgeesmusings.net/2010/09/20/finding-knowledge-work-practices-worth-emulating-and-adapting/) has some excellent insights that expand on the idea of craft work, putting it in concrete terms of knowledge work, in this case the "trade" of software development.

My brothers both work in a trade (plumbing and electrician), and I’ve had many conversations with them about the process within the trade unions of developing young plumbers and electricians from apprentice through the master grade. It's made me wonder how I ended up where I am, how I learned to do the job I do. A bit less structured than their experience, that's for sure.

How did you learn how to be a knowledge worker? Did you spend your early years in an “apprenticeship” or were you just thrown into the fray? How do we help new knowledge workers learn their craft? How do we get knowledge workers, new or otherwise, to accept their profession as a craft? And how do we, as experienced knowledge workers, become even better at it?
