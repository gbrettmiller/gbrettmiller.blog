There are many ways to use [Twitter](http://twitter.com), and at least as many ways to (try to) explain Twitter to people who haven't yet given it a try. The one I'm most often faced with is from an "average Joe / Jane" that isn't interested in knowing what someone is having for lunch or that they are changing a really nasty diaper. This is what I've come up with for them:

> **Twitter is a way to meet people.** That's it. What you do with it beyond that is entirely up to you.

Of course, this simple answer rarely convinces anyone, so I continue with something like this.

> Think about the last time you went to a party, or out to a club. Chances are you went with a friend, or a group of friends, and didn't know everyone there. But by the end of the night, you knew more people than before and maybe even made a connection on a personal or professional level with someone. Twitter is exactly the same, only different.
> 
> If you follow me on Twitter, you will get to see the conversations I'm involved in, and you can join in whenever you want. If you decide that the other person in the conversation is interesting enough to talk to without me around, you can follow them. You will then see who they talk to and what they talk about, and I guarantee that you will find someone that shares your deep interest in something.
> 
> The more conversations you get involved in, and the more you follow, the more you will see the different ways that you can use Twitter for whatever you want to use it for.

This is pretty much how my own use of Twitter has evolved. There are a gazillion ways to use it, and there are some uses that hold no interest for me. (I also don't care to hear about that nasty diaper on Twitter - that's what Facebook is for.) But [I've found ways to use it](http://twitter.com/gbrettmiller) that work for me, so can you.

You just have to start.
