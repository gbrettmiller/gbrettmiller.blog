When addressing the idea of tacit knowledge in respect to knowledge management, most descriptions focus on the tacit knowledge **IN** organizations – that is, the tacit knowledge of the individual members of the organization – and how to capture and share that tacit knowledge. While I believe it is important to understand this tacit knowledge, I’ve always been more attracted to an understanding of the tacit knowledge **OF** an organization, what it is the organization as a whole ‘knows.’

As with individuals, organizations operate based on the tacit knowledge they possess and their ability to act on that knowledge when needed. In the human brain it is the connections between neurons – and the ability of the brain to reorganize those connections to meet the situation – that makes up the intelligence and tacit knowledge of the individual. In organizations, it is the connections between people. (see this [post of mine from 2006](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2006/the-tacit-knowledge-of-not-in-organizations) for a bit more on this.)

Many years ago, in one of my first ever blog posts, I wrote that "KM is the neuroscience of an organization." After reading [Is Enterprise 2.0 the neuro-organization?](http://www.boostzone.fr/is-enterprise-2-0-the-neuro-organization-3/) a couple of days ago, and a brief discussion with Harold Jarche ([@hjarche](http://twitter.com/hjarche)), I was once again curious.

Here's a start. (_Definitions from Wikipedia)_

[Neurology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology): a medical specialty dealing with disorders of the nervous system. Specifically, it deals with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of disease involving the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems, including their coverings, blood vessels, and all effector tissue, such as muscle.  **_\-->OD ?_**

[Neuroscience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience): the scientific study of the nervous system, the scope of neuroscience has broadened to include different approaches used to study the molecular, developmental, structural, functional, evolutionary, computational, and medical aspects of the nervous system. **_\--> KM?  IT?_**

[Psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology): the scientific study of human or animal mental functions and behaviors, psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring underlying physiological and neurological processes.  **_\--> OD? Training/Learning?_**

[Psychiatry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry): the medical specialty devoted to the study and treatment of mental disorders—which include various affective, behavioural, cognitive and perceptual disorders; mental disorders are currently conceptualized as disorders of brain circuits likely caused by developmental processes shaped by a complex interplay of genetics and experience.  **_\--> HR?_**

Way off base? On the right track?
