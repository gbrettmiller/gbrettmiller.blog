I've blogged for many years, shared photos on Flickr and video on YouTube, and more recently joined Twitter and Facebook. Finding the line for any parent is challenging, but as the parent of an autistic son the question of how much - and what - to share about my family in public (the blog, twitter) and even in "private" (facebook) takes on a whole different dimension.

Later this week, Chris Heuer from [Social Media Club](http://socialmediaclub.org/) is bringing their Fall Tour 2010, [Social Media + Family](http://socialmediaclub.org/event/social-media-club-fall-tour-2010-social-media-family), to [St. Louis](http://smf2010stlouis.eventbrite.com/) to talk about these questions and more.  To get an idea of how the conversation may go, take a look at [Amani's recap of the Atlanta event](http://socialmediaclub.org/blogs/from-the-clubhouse/social-media-family-atlanta-recap). To get ready, St. Louisan Todd Jordan (aka [@tojosan](http://twitter.com/tojosan)), a parent and [speaker at this week's event](http://www.toddrjordan.com/thebroadbrush/2010/09/social-media-family-st-louis-stlouis/), has posted his "[bio of an online Dad](http://www.toddrjordan.com/thebroadbrush/short-bio-online-dad/)".

I don't know how much, if at all, the discussion will go towards families of kids with disabilities, but even if it doesn't go there at all  I have a feeling it is going to be a great evening of conversation and a great excuse to get out and socialize in person (as if an excuse is ever really needed).
