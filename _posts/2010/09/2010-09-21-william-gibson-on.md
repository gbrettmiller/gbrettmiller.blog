![](images/Gibson_William_400.jpg "William Gibson")This past weekend I had the pleasure of meeting author [William Gibson](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com) when he came through St. Louis [promoting](http://williamgibsonbooks.com/source/tour.asp) his latest book, [Zero History](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399156828?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0399156828)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0399156828). He started off  by reading a bit from the book and then opened it up for questions from the standing room only crowd.

Here are some notes from the conversations that ensued:

**_...dystopia_**

When asked if he saw the world as bleak as the dystopias he depicts in his books, Gibson made the comment to the effect, "Dystopia is in the eye of the beholder". From the perspective of the affluent, who have a strong interest in maintaining the status quo, his worlds may be dystopic, but there are plenty of people in the world who would see those worlds as a big step up.

**_...brands and marketing in his writing_**

Gibson references many real brands as part of his stories, and when asked said that you can't really write a book about current times, especially in a big city like London, without branding and marketing being brightly on display. That is the world we live in, to not include it would make the whole story feel a bit false. This ties into his overall philosophy of naturalism in his writing.

**_...his career_**

When asked if his career turned out how expected, or hoped, it would, Gibson glibly commented that he never thought he'd have a writing career at all. His first novel, the best-selling [Neuromancer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441012035?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0441012035)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0441012035), was written on commission and he fully expected that the first small printing would also be the last. All in all, I think he's very happy with how it turned out.

**_...didactism_**

Asked about whether his writing reflects his own ideas that he is trying to spread, Gibson quickly said no. Didactism is a legitimate approach to writing, but he's found that if you do that it is at the expense of the story and the characters. On the subject of characters and character development, he went on to say that if you - as an author - know what your characters are going to do before they do it, then you are also shortchanging the story. "I never know what my characters are going to do, and sometimes they do things that I wish they hadn't."

**_...freelancers vs. salaried workers_**

Gibson noted that his stories tend to have freelancers as the good guys and "salaried workers" as the bad guys, and said that this wasn't really intentional (see comments on didactism above). He did note that not everyone that "works for the man" is bad, and in fact one of the key good guys of the current book is one of those salaried workers.

**_...twitter_**

When I asked him how he came up with his own Twitter handle, Gibson explained that a friend had told him about it so he figured he'd check it out, fully expecting to think it stupid and not worth keeping up with. When prompted for a user name, he looked up on his shelf and saw a book about The Great Dismal Swamp; hence, [@GreatDismal](http://twitter.com/GreatDismal). After about 5 minutes with Twitter, he found that he loved it. For the first time, he said, authors could get the same direct feedback - good and bad - from their fans that those in sports, film, etc did.

...

Gibson also made some comments about cultural history and cultural memory, noting that today's generation of young adults have no idea what it was like to live in constant  fear of nuclear annihilation.  Whether this is a good thing or not remains to be seen. I  have a few other notes, but unfortunately even I am unable to read the scribble that I hurriedly wrote down.

(Just one more reason, as if I need one, that I want an iPad.)

A special thanks to [Left Bank Books](http://www.left-bank.com/) and the Schlafly Branch of [St. Louis Public library](http://www.slpl.org) for hosting this stop on Gibson's [book tour](http://williamgibsonbooks.com/source/tour.asp), and to [Dennis Kennedy](http://twitter.com/denniskennedy) for making me aware of it. And, of course, to [William Gibson](http://twitter.com/GreatDismal) for coming to town.
