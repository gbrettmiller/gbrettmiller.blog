Last week Seth Godin wrote that [rehearsing is for cowards](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/09/rehearsing-is-for-cowards.html). My first thought when I saw that headline was, "Seth Godin just called me a coward!" Â If you've read my [The importance of rehearsal](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/the-importance-of-rehearsal/), you know what I mean.

Like most of Godin's writing, though, you have to take this one in the spirit in which it is written - deliberately extreme headline to catch your attention and then a very specific context in which it applies. In this case, his definition of rehearsal is very narrow and, to me, is really a definition of memorization.

At the end of the article he says that "A well-rehearsed performance will go without a hitch." As if that is a bad thing. If you are trying to create your art live, then obviously it is bad. But not all art is created live and unfiltered, unedited.

Some art is created in post-production, when the book / album / film is edited into it's final form.

And some art is created in pre-production, during rehearsal as things are tried and discarded, tried and changed, or new things added.

Rehearsal is simply editing in pre-production.
