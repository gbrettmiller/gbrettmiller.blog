Every year when April - otherwise known as [Autism Awareness Month](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=autism+awareness+month+2010) - rolls around, I ask myself, "Awareness? Awareness of what exactly?" Most times I forget my own advice and try to find a "one-size-fits-all" answer to the question. (My advice: there is no such thing as one-size-fits-all for anything.) Some times I just bail on the question altogether.

This year I decided to try something different. Instead of trying to go "big picture" awareness, I'm going to focus on one aspect - a theme, if you will - of autism awareness. A consistent theme throughout all the various incarnations of this blog, not to mention my life as the parent of an autistic son, has always been that **autistic people are just people like everyone else**, with the same unique needs and desires as anyone else. It seems fitting that I use that as my theme.

Everyone is different, of course. The challenge with autism is that autistic kids and adults are different in a different way, a way that many people are not familiar with and - more importantly - not comfortable with.

So, for the next month I am going to revisit and repost some old articles and write a few new ones to build on this theme. I will also be looking around the web for others talking about the same theme. If I can make just one person more aware that **autistic people are just people like everyone else**, I will consider my efforts a success.

Of course, I'm expecting to reach more people than that.
