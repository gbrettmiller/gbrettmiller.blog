What motivational methods make some of you cringe (or worse)?

This is one of the questions that [Dan Pink](http://www.danpink.com) posed to the group participating in his [live chat at The Book Club](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/bookclub/2010/02/live-chat-dan-pink.html) on the New Yorker. In response to theÂ "Don't make mistakes because I (mgr,owner, boss) will think less of you" motivational method, he said:

> That's one of the most insidious, imho. To me, it's one of the greatest flaws in organizations. **People are more scared of failure than of mediocrity.** It should be the reverse. (emphasis mine)
> 
> Making a mistake is like breaking a leg. It happens and you fix it. Mediocrity is like a chronic, cancerous disease that gradually destroys you and from which recovery is far more difficult.

In the short term, mediocrity is "safe" and "going for it" is not. Or at least it doesn't seem to be. (I can't go for it, what if I make a mistake?)

Personally, I'd rather get a few broken bones along the way than spend my life trying to avoid those things that might cause them.

How about you?
