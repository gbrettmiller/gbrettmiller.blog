In his book Mastery, George Leonard talks about the "war on mastery". This could just as easily be called a "war on hard". Watch TV for just a couple of minutes and you will be bombarded with ads or talk shows or news stories that show you how do something in just a couple (if that many) steps. You never see something that promises to be hard.

And yet, nearly anything worth doing - that results in growth or learning - is hard. The best you can really hope for from "easy" is to maintain what you've already got. At worse, you will lose something.

Does Google - or technology in general - make us stupid? No. But by being "easy", it removes the need, and possibly the ability, to learn. Which some might say is the same thing.
