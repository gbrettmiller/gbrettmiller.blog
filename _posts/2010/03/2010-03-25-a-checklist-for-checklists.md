It's easy to say, "Make a checklist for your complex process and use it". It's another thing altogether to actually make a checklist that is good and that works.

One of the things that I like most about [The Checklist Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805091742?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0805091742) is that it recognizes and addresses the challenges inherent in designing a good checklist. In fact, a good part of the story revolves around making the WHO surgical checklist a good one. In the acknowledgements section of the book, Gawande credits Boeing engineer Dan Boorman (who is also mentioned in the book) as an "essential partner" in the ongoing development of new checklists, and from the looks of it they've been [hard at work](http://www.projectcheck.org/index.html).

Most relevant to my ongoing thread here is the [Checklist for Checklists](http://www.projectcheck.org/checklist-for-checklists.html), pictured below. If you have decided that checklists can help you, this is an excellent place to start as you begin the process of developing your checklists.
