On the TV show NCIS the main character, Special Agent Gibbs, has two primary passions: catching bad guys and building boats. Not just any kind of boat, but hand made wooden sailboats. Which he builds in his basement. (A running gag on the show is the question of how he gets the boats out of the basement.)

In one episode, an old friend and mentor visits Gibbs for the first time in several years and sees a boat in progress in the basement:

> "What's this, number 3?"  
> "Four."  
> "I thought you'd have enough practice by now."  
> "**There's always something to learn.**"

Truly words to live by, even if they do come from a fictional character.
