_My [earlier post on games](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/life-is-not-a-game-or-is-it/) got me digging through my archives (yet again), where I found two posts looking at knowledge management and knowledge work through the lens of games. Both of these posts are based on James Paul Gee's book [What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1403984530?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1403984530)._

_This first post looks at the learning aspects of knowledge management and knowledge work. It could use a little updating, especially the part about "managing tacit knowledge" (which we all know can't be managed), but I'm still pleased with it overall._

After reading (and [writing about](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/video-games-future-of-education-or-harmful-addiction/ "NSL - Video Games: Future of education or harmful addiction?")) [Marc Prensky](http://www.marcprensky.com/experience/Prensky-Bio.pdf "Bio - Marc Prensky")’s [Don’t Bother Me, Mom, I’m Learning!](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/1557788588/105-0704870-6814832 "aStore - Don't Bother Me Mom, I'm Learning!"), I picked up [James Paul Gee](http://website.education.wisc.edu/gls/people_gee.htm "Bio - James Gee (UW-Madison)")’s[What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/1403965382/002-9091504-7932015 "aStore - What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy"). I was expecting a book about video games and the potential ‘good’ they offered. And the book does discuss this.

But the book is really about how video games are an example of how good learning can be enabled, encouraged, and accomplished in any environment. His area of choice is K-12 science education, but the learning principles – [36 of them](http://edtechlife.com/?p=32 "Educational Technology and Life - A Reflection on Gee’s 36 Principles of “Video Game Like” Learning")– can be applied in many other areas.

In fact, Gee compares the environment that players of modern computer and video games inhabit to the world of what is commonly known as [knowledge work](http://www.kwork.org/ "AOK: A virtual home for knowledge workers and managers"). In the process, Gee describes a couple of key concepts and processes that those who work in the field of [knowledge management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management "wikipedia:  Knowledge Management") will be familiar with.

Because Gee looks at these topics from the perspective of learning, his depictions are a bit different from what I’ve typically seen. For example, here is how Gee describes ‘[tacit knowledge](http://www.google.com/search?q=tacit+knowledge "tacit knowledge - Google search results")‘ (emphasis is mine):

> Finally, the Intuitive (Tacit) Knowledge Principle is concerned with the fact that video games honor not just the explicit and verbal knowledge players have about how to play but also the intuitive or tacit knowledge – _built into their movements, bodies, and unconscious ways of thinking_ – they have built up through _repeated practice with a family of genre_ of games. It is common today for research on modern workplaces to point out that in today’s high-tech and fast-changing world, the most valuable knowledge a business has is the _tacit knowledge its workers gain through continually working with others_ in a “community of practice” that _adapts to specific situations and changes “on the ground” as they happen_. Such knowledge cannot always be verbalized. Even when it can be verbalized and placed in a training manual, by that time it is often out of date.

What stood out to me was the emphasis on the importance of the “community of practice” in the development of an individual’s tacit knowledge and the fact that tacit knowledge is dynamic, never fixed. Tacit knowledge is, in my experience, typically addressed as something unique to an individual, something static. And while it is true, I suppose, that individuals do possess a certain amount of truly unique knowledge that never changes, to be useful most tacit knowledge must be flexible enough to be useful as the individual interacts with the environment.

A key challenge in the field of knowledge management is how to manage this tacit knowledge. Understanding both the individual and social nature of tacit knowledge is an important consideration to keep in mind. In fact, the social aspect, the tacit knowledge of the group if you will, may well be more important than the tacit knowledge of any one individual.
