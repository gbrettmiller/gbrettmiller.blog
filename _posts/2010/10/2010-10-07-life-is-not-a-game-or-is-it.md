Games, especially video games, have always been a big part of my life, both when I was young and now with my family. We all know that games are an important part of growing up, and despite the bad rap that video games get they can be a very positive experience, too.

Over the past few years, I've also been contemplating the role games, including video [games](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/?s=video+games), influence our life and work. In my "to blog" list, I have a draft, started about 3 years ago, called "Welcome to the World of KnowledgeCraft".

A couple of days ago, [Hacking Work](http://www.hackingwork.com/2010/09/are-we-presenting-the-best-version-of-ourselves/) posted this [TED Talk from Jane McGonical](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/799) in which she tells us that if we want to solve the world’s big problems — hunger, war, environmental devastation and more — we need to be gaming more.

Time to dust off that draft and add my own thoughts.
