[![Thiagi](images/031908-1950-thepathsofk1.png)](http://www.thiagi.com)In his foreword to [Marc Prensky](http://www.marcprensky.com/)'s book [Digital Game-Based Learning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1557788634?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1557788634)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1557788634), Sivasailam "Thiagi" ThiagarajanÂ ([@thiagi](http://twitter.com/thiagi "Thiagi on Twitter")) recounts the following (emphasis is mine):

> Early in my life, my mentor explained to me the three paths that lead to the creation of knowledge. The **analytical** path, where philosophers reflect, meditate, and make sense of objects and events; the **empirical** path, where scientists manipulate variables and conduct controlled experiments to validate reliable principles; and the **pragmatic** path where practitioners struggle with real-world challenges and come up with strategies for effective and efficient performance.

Each of these paths can be taken in isolation from the others, we see that every day. It is also common to see these paths taken one after the other: analyze -> experiment -> implement.

More challenging, and much more powerful, is to integrate these three trails into a single path that allows you to go from trail to trail as needed to get you where you want to go.
