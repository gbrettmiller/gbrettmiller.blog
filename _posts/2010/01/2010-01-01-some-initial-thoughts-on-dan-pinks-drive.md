I read [39 books in 2009](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1852826?shelf=50-books--09-), just "a few" shy of my goal of 50. Thanks to a little nudge from Art Johnson ([@artjohnson](http://twitter.com/artjohnson)) and [some tips](http://inoveryourhead.net/how-to-read-a-book-a-week-in-2010/) from [Julien Smith](http://inoveryourhead.net/about-julien/), I've set my 2010 sights just a little bit higher: a book a week, for a total of 52.

I got the list off to a good start this evening when I finished Dan Pink's latest, [Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594488843?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594488843)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1594488843). Interestingly, one of the first books I read in 2009 was also one of his, [A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594481717?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594481717)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1594481717).

In that previous book, as the title suggests, Pink describes the type of workers that will emerge - actually are emerging - to solve the complex business and social problems now facing us. Taking that as a starting point in Drive, Pink provides some guidance on what will be necessary to "manage" these new types of worker by exploring the what motivates these workers to perform. Or, as the title put its, what drives them.

It comes down to three basic things that people want and need for fulfillment and satisfaction: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Longtime readers of my blogs know that [mastery](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/tag/mastery/) is a concept I've long thought and written about. Pink's chapter on mastery in the context of work pulls together many ideas that I've struggled with over the years.

This chapter alone was worth the price of the book. All the rest is an excellent bonus.
