Today is an interesting day for me. It is the first day that I am living beyond the age that my dad was when he died. Although I don't feel old - and my kids would tell you I don't act old, or at least not my age - knowing that I have now outlived my dad brings things into a different kind of focus.

I'm happy with my life, my work, my family. I'm not going to go out and make any drastic changes. But I will look at each day just a little bit differently, knowing that each day is a gift for me to enjoy, and make the most of Â it.

I hope you'll do the same.
