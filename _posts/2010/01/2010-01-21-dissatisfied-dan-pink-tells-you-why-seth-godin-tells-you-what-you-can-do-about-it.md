In his new book, [Drive](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594488843?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=1594488843), author [Dan Pink](http://www.danpink.com) talks about what really motivates us, the "instrinsic drive" that we want to - but don't always - follow. He describes the three pillars of this instrinsic motivation: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. These three, working in concert, provide the foundation for satisfaction, and if any of these are missing, or are somehow externally constrained, chances are you are unhappy to some degree. This applies to the job that you hate, or the relationship you are "stuck in". (On the flip side, if you are happy in your job - or relationship - chances are you have an adequate amount of all three.)

In his new book, [Linchpin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843162?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=1591843162), author [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typedpad.com) tells you that your happiness is entirely up to you. You can be a "factory worker" - where you give up your autonomy, opportunity for mastery, and work to achieve someone else's purpose - or you can be an artist - where you practice autonomy, master what it is you are doing, and work to your own purpose. And while many authors will tell you how to go about this by "planning your career" or finding the "ideal job". Â Godin tells you that you can achieve this **without changing jobs**. It is your choice: artist or factory worker.

Taken together, these two books can give you a powerful insight into what you are dissatisfied with in your life and your work, why you are dissatisfied, and what you can do about it. All you have to do is figure out what you want to be, a factory worker or an artist.

Me? I choose art.
