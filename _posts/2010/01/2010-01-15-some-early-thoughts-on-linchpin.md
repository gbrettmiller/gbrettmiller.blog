In the letter that he sent along with the early review copies of his new book [Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843162?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591843162), Seth Godin asks us to "read it through (twice if you can)" before we review it. I get the impression from his letter, and from his introduction to the book, that he expects many people won't like it, or won't agree with it, and that many people will stop reading before they finish.

From my point about 1/2 way through I can see why he might think that; some people are going to find his ideas and suggestions quite radical. I really hope those people who don't agreee, or don't understand, take the time to read the entire book and reflect deeply on what it says. They will come out better for it, even if they still don't agree with what Seth says.

That's all I'm going to say here about Linchpin for now, I am going to wait until I've had a chance to go through it twice and really absorb it before I write an actual review. If you want to know what others are already saying about the book, check out the [Linchpin lens](http://www.squidoo.com/linchpin) on [Squidoo](http://www.squidoo.com/linchpin).
