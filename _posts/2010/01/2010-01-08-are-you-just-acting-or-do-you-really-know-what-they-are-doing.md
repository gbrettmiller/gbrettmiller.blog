![The Ultimate Matrix Collection](images/3-3f.jpg)I love the [Matrix](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OPPBEQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gbrettmiller-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000OPPBEQ) movies. All three of them. (Four if you count [Animatrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animatrix).) As someone interested in learning and knowledge management, I find the whole idea of being able to simply download knowledge and really, truly learn how to do something very cool. Need to know how to fly a helicopter off a roof and across the city? There's an app for that.

Compare this to the [process that the actors went through](http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/magazine/article.php?article=151) to be able to provide convincing performances of these skills.  The actors trained for several months in order to obtain a sufficient level of physical readiness, then learned some basic martial arts skills. Hong Kong director and fight choreographer [Yuen Woo Ping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuen_Woo_Ping) created the fight sequences, which the actors then learned.

From a knowledge management perspective, this is an excellent comparison of tacit vs. explicit knowledge.

The fight choreographers developed the fight scenes, then made the “knowledge” of the fight (in this case the choreography) explicit so the actors could “learn” the fight. But, and here is the important part, the actors did not learn “how to fight” but rather “how to perform the fight” for the film. They were acting on explicit knowledge, but it never really became “tacit.”

On the other hand, the stunt men portraying the bad guys obviously had the tacit knowledge of how to fight – you can see it in how they carry themselves and the weapons. For them, it was a matter of taking the new choreography and incorporating it into what they already knew.

From a learning perspective this shows the difference between what Carol Dweck refers to as performance goals and learning goals. Quoted in [Dan Pink](http://www.danpink.com)'s new book [Drive](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594488843?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=1594488843) Dweck says, "Both goals are entirely normal and nearly universal, and both can fuel achievement."

Inside the Matrix, the goals are learning goals. The characters need to actually learn the skills they need. For the actors, the goals were performance goals. Not what you'd call easy, but much easier than actually learning the martial arts and engaging in fights with other masters.

In your job, are you  an  "actor", trying to provide a performance that follows the script and meets the approval of "the audience." Or are you a master, continually learning and improving and getting done what needs to get done?
