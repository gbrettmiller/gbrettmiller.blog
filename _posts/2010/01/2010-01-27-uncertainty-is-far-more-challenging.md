In [How Life Imitates Chess: Making the Right Moves, from the Board to the Boardroom](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OMHVEQ?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001OMHVEQ), former world chess champion [Gary Kasparov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov) discusses the challenges of solving "puzzles":

> Knowing a solution is at hand is a huge advantage; it’s like not having a “none of the above” option. Anyone with reasonable competence and adequate resources can solve a puzzle when it is presented as something to be solved. We can skip the subtle evaluations and move directly to plugging in possible solutions until we hit upon a promising one. Uncertainty is far more challenging. Instead of immediately looking for solutions to the crisis, we have to maintain a constant state of asking, “Is there a crisis forming?”

This is the future work. As Harold Jarche mentions in his recent post [A Linchpin Culture](http://www.jarche.com/2010/01/a-linchpin-culture/) (in which he discusses [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com)'s latest book):

> The work that we will be paid for is the difficult, innovative, one of a kind, creative stuff.... We will be facing more complexity and chaos in our work. There are fewer easy answers, easy jobs with good pay, or simple ways to keep a job for life.

Solving a puzzle that you know has a solution may require knowledge, but it is knowledge that already exists. Figuring out if there is a solution to a problem, or even if there is a problem at all, requires the manipulation of existing knowledge, the gathering of new knowledge / information, and the creation of something new.

In other words, it requires art.
