During a New Year's Day seminar in which he spoke about some things he would be tracking and doing in 2010, [Dan Pink](http://www.danpink.com) made an offhand comment that "I like lists". This comment, along with the coming of the new year and the inspiration from the seminar, prompted me to create a new "brain" - using [PersonalBrain 5.5](http://www.thebrain.com) - to collect the lists and other resources that I find useful.

Some of the thoughts in that brain will eventually find their way into a blog post or other writing somewhere, but much of it won't. That doesn't mean that it's not good information, or that it isn't worth sharing, so I've [**uploaded the brain**](http://webbrain.com/u/10YK) to [WebBrain.com](http://webbrain.com) as a way to share. It is very much a work in progress, both in terms of content and visual design, and as I continue to build it I will work on both. Let me know if you have any suggestions or ideas to add.

Here's a quick look at the brain, and you can see it full size [over at WebBrain.com](http://webbrain.com/u/10YK). I may eventually find a permanent place here on my site for the brain, but for now I'll just keep it there.
