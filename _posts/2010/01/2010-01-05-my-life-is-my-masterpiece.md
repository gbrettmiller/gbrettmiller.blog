Just inside the entrance to the [Art of Living Building](http://stlouis.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2005/12/12/story7.html) in Downtown St. Louis is the following quote:

> A **master** in the **_art of living_** draws no sharp distinction between
> 
> his **WORK** and his **PLAY his **LABOR** and his **LEISURE** his **MIND** and his **BODY** his **EDUCATION** and his **RECREATIONS**.**
> 
> **_He hardly knows which is which_.**
> 
> He simply pursues his **_vision of excellence_** through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing.
> 
> **To himself, he always seems to be doing both**.

I write this in at the beginning of every new notebook I start, so it is always there to remind me of something that is all too easy to forget:

> **My life is my masterpiece.**

Like any artistic process, living a good life requires a bit of effort on your part. But isn't a little bit of effort to create a good life worth all that it gives back?
