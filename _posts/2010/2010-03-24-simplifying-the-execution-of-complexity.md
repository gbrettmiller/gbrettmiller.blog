My [review](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/navigating-complexity-with-checklists-a-book-review/) of Atul Gawande's latest book [The Checklist Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805091742?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0805091742) focused, by design, on the broad scope of the book. Within that "big picture" lesson, though, are many smaller, more specific lessons to be learned.

For example:

> No, the real lesson is that under conditions of true complexity - where the knowledge required exceeds that of any individual and unpredictability reigns - efforts to dictate every step from the center will fail. People need room to act and adapt. Yet they cannot succeed as isolated individuals, either - that is anarchy....
> 
> \[U\]nder conditions of complexity, not only are checklists a help, they are _**required**_ for success. There must always be room for judgment, but judgment aided - and even enhanced - by procedure.

During this discussion, he refers back to what he had learned from the skyscraper-building industry, that they had figured out how to put an understanding of complexity into a series of checklists. That they had, in Gawande's words, "made the reliable management of complexity a routine."

What makes this even more fascinating is how the checklist, the lowly checklist that [Steven Levitt](http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/home.html) had no interest in ([until reading this book](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/04/the-checklist-manifesto/)), can help simplify the execution of complexity even when the team members have never before worked together.

Just think what they could do for a team that works together all the time.
