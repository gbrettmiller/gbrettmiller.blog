I am reading [Clay Shirky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky)'s book [Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594202532?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594202532)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1594202532) and will share my thoughts once I've completed it, but wanted to share this little tidbit now.

The idea of [true competition](http://truecompetition.org/) is one that really resonates with me and is something I've been trying to make sense of in a work and business environment. Shirky has a great description of the collaborative nature of **true competition** (page 102):

> The spread of these \[skateboarding\] techniques was driven by spirited competition. We often think of competition as pure conflict, the way firms compete in a market, happy to drive one another out of business. In groups of people who know one another and share the same interests, though, competition can take on a collaborative quality. the Z-Boys competed not to end the development of skating technique but to extend it. Instead of trying to come to some final or right way of skating, or to master some hidden and uncopyable technique, they developed new styles and tricks out in the open, challenging in order to invite a response.

They weren't doing it to "[win](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/if-your-purpose-is-to-win/)", they were doing it to learn, and to create, because they loved it.

If you haven't read the book, I can already tell you that I recommend it (even though I haven't finished reading it). In the meantime, take a few minutes and check out his [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/) on how cognitive surplus will change the world:

You should also take a few minutes and read [Luis Suarez's thoughts on the video](http://www.elsua.net/2010/08/13/cognitive-surplus-and-the-hippie-2-0-connection/).
