I saw a quote on a discussion board recently in a conversation about telecommuting and taking care of personal business during work time: If they want me to answer my email at night and on the weekends, they shouldn't have a problem with me making personal calls or email during the day.

One of the recurring themes in Seth Godin's latest book, Linchpin, is the idea that the way to succeed in the future is to move away from factory work - of all kinds, either physical or intellectual. In the blog post [Goodbye to the Office](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/06/goodbye-to-the-office.html), he makes explicit his point that the modern office is just a different type of factory. And that if you are doing your work outside the office even a little, why do even need the office in the first place?

Which got me thinking: Is there a future for the weekend? If not, is that a bad thing? A good thing? Just "a thing"?

The modern weekend, of course, is as it is based on a century of factory work, office work, and public education. The same can be said for winter break, spring break, and summer vacation. People want (need? demand?) time to get away from the grind, and expect their work life and their life work be kept separate.

But if you no longer need the factory, if you no longer need the office, do you really need the weekend (or spring break or summer vacation) to get away from it all?
