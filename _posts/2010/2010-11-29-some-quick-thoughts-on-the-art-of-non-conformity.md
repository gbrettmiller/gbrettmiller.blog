[![](images/aonc-cover.png "Cover - The Art of Non-Conformity")](http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/the-book/)[Chris Guillebeau](http://chrisguillebeau.com/)'s new book, [The Art of Non-Conformity](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399536108?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0399536108),![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0399536108) is clear, concise, and gets straight to the point. Chris tries to eliminate "busy work" from his life, and he's done an excellent job of eliminating "busy reading" from this book.

This is a book about living the life that you want to live and not the life that someone else wants you to live. And that is what I found most refreshing about the book: Chris isn't saying be a rebel and do things just because someone else said you couldn't (or shouldn't); he's saying don't do something just because someone else says you should.

The message is a positive one - figure out what it is that you want from your life and do that. And allow - encourage - others to do the same. This last point, I think, is especially valuable for parents, whoÂ should read this book and keep it in mind as they raise their kids and prepare them for their own adventures in the world. (A [theme I've touched on before](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/parents-should-be-leaders-not-managers/ "Parents should be leaders, not managers").)

If you are not currently a non-conformist, you will think "no way" and "he's crazy" more than once as you read through this book; but if you make it all the way through you'll thank him for it in the end. If you think you are already a non-conformist, you will likely realize that you really aren't; that you are perhaps more rebel and less non-conformist.

A must read for just about everyone.
