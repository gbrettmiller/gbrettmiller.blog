Music. Movies. Higher education. What do these three things have in common?

**A solid entrenchment in the 'good old days' and an incredible unwillingness to engage the present, much less the future, of their industries**.

At least that's the impression I have a little more than halfway through Anya Kamenetz's latest book, "DIY U: Edupunks, Edupreneurs, and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education".

Kind of like the story of librarians told in "This book is overdue", where there are many dedicated individuals who see the possibilities but who must first overcome the 'institution'.

A lot to think about.
