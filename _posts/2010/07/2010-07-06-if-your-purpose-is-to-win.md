...you have already lost.

Competing - and hopefully winning - can be a key part of any journey, but it shouldn't be the destination. If reaching your destination is all you have to look forward to, what happens when you get there?

Or as I tell my sons: the goal of competition is, of course, to win, but your purpose - for training, for competing - should be to learn, to grow. To have fun.
