Which type of person do you prefer to work with, someone who thrashes early and gets things quietly done, or someone who swoops in at the end for some last minute heroics?

Which type of person receives the most attention in your organization? Are you more likely to hear, "John was squared away and relaxed when it was time to ship" or "Did you see that incredible last push John made, working all night so he could meet ship date?"

Which type are you?

Next time you find yourself in a situation where you see some people cramming like crazy, and others sitting back apparently doing nothing, take a moment to think about which ones you'd prefer to have work with you to ship your product.
