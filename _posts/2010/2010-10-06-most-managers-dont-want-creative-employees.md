[![](images/mota.gif "mota")](https://gbrettmiller.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/mota.gif)A couple of summers ago I read [Management of the Absurd](http://www.amazon.com/Management-Absurd-Richard-Farson/dp/0684830442/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1214596820&sr=8-1) by Richard Farson. The book lives up to its title and one that I heartily recommend. It contains a wealth of ideas and views on management that you don’t often come across.

For example, this on the management of creativity:

> Real creativity, the kind that is responsible for breakthrough changes in our society, always violates the rules. That is why it is so unmanageable and that is why, in most organizations, when we say we desire creativity we really mean manageable creativity. We don’t mean raw, dramatic, radical creativity that requires us to change.

As much as managers and organizations say they want to be innovative and groundbreaking, they usually don’t mean they want each of their individual employees to be innovative and groundbreaking. They want the rules to be followed, because that's how things are supposed to work. They don't believe that rules [are meant to be broken](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/some-rules-are-meant-to-be-broken/).

The real message, though, is this: break the rules and be successful and we'll back you all the way, but break the rules and fail and you are on your own.

This is something that Seth Godin talks about quite a bit. Don't expect any cover from your boss when you try something new, he tells us, because that's not your boss's job. If your creativity, your art, is important to you, the best thing you can do is to simply do it. Or, as he says in [Linchpin](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/seth-godin-wants-you-to-become-a-linchpin/):

> The reason you might choose to embrace the artist within you now is that this is the path to (cue the ironic music) security. When it is time for layoffs, the safest job belongs to the artist, the linchpin, the one who can’t be easily outsourced or replaced.

_Update: This post is an updated version of something I first wrote in June 2008. I was inspired to update it by a common search term in my referral logs ([rules are meant to be broken](http://www.google.com/search?q=rules+are+meant+to+be+broken)), my earlier post [(Some) Rules are meant to be broken](https://gbrettmiller.blog/2009/07/30/some-rules-are-meant-to-be-broken/), and the recent series of [Hey Leaders, Wake Up!](http://www.hackingwork.com/2010/10/hey-leaders-wake-up-youre-in-control-really/) posts at [hackingwork.com](http://www.hackingwork.com)._
