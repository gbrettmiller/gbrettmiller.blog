I've been following Luis Suarez' ([@elsua](http://twitter.com/elsua)) thoughts on a [world without e-mail](http://www.elsua.net/tag/a-world-without-email/) for quite a while now. His arguments have always made sense, and yet I've always had this nagging feeling of, "Yeah, but...."

Last week I had a chance to [view/listen to a recent presentation](https://www-950.ibm.com/files/app?lang=en#/person/270001WBU5/file/09d150b9-6add-4c3b-8fa5-8be5b5b39b7e) Luis gave about making the jump from e-mail to social media tools, along with the mind map - no PowerPoint, either! - that goes with it, appropriately subtitled [E-mail is where knowledge goes to die](http://www.mindmeister.com/56757692/a-world-without-email-email-is-where-knowledge-goes-to-die). I think I finally understand.

After listening to the presentation, and talking with some co-workers and others about it, one of the most common comments I heard was, "That sounds great, but it looks so hard. Why would I want to do make my life and my work **harder**?"

It was then that I realized that when most people who are tied to e-mail hear this argument about social media vs. e-mail, they apparently think that moving their work is supposed to make doing their job **easier**. But that's not what it's about at all.

Using social media isn't about **easy**, it's about **better**. More effective, more productive, less wasteful; however you define "better".

In e-mail, there is no learning, no opportunity to learn.  In fact, e-mail practically screams "non-learning environment". Despite what it is you are actually trying to accomplish in your work, you spend a good amount of time trying to stay out of "mail jail". When someone new joins your team or your project, they will never catch up. How can they, when all the knowledge has died in e-mail archives that are "somewhere else".

With social media, nearly every transaction is a learning opportunity. Sure you'll spend as much time sorting through all your social media contacts and messages as you do processing e-mail. But with social media, you are forced to make sense of the information, all the while creating and sharing new knowledge about whatever it is you are working on.

Of course, if you don't care about learning, about improving, about becoming more effective, then sticking with e-mail is fine.
