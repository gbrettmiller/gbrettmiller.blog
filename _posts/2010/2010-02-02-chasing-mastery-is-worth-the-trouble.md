In his book [Outliers: The Story of Success](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017922?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0316017922) (which I will be reviewing soon), Malcolm Gladwell discusses the 10,000 hour rule, which states that to achieve mastery - of anything - requires 10,000 hours of [deliberate practice](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/tag/deliberatepractice/). (Readers of Geoff Colvin's [Talent is Overrated](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842247?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=1591842247) will recognize this idea, as well.) This is, to put it mildly, a lot of hours.

Last week a couple of bloggers I follow asked themselves if they thought all this effort was worth it.  From [Did I Say That Out Loud?](http://www.amylovesbud.com/2010/01/expertise.html)

> So then the next question is do I even want to be an expert at anything? Is it worth 10,000 hours to master something so completely? Or is my time better spent doing the daily tasks in front of me the best that I can? Or is there some organic blend of the two?

And from [Penelope Trunk's Brazen Careerist](http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2010/01/28/being-an-expert-takes-time-not-talent/):

> There are a few things about the article \[[The Making of an Expert](http://hbr.org/2007/07/the-making-of-an-expert/ar/1) by [Anders Ericsson](http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson.dp.html), [Michael Prietula](http://www.goizueta.emory.edu/Faculty/MichaelPrietula/) and [Edward Cokely](http://ntfm.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/mpib/FMPro?-db=MPIB_Mitarbeiter.FP5&-lay=L1&-format=MPIB_Mit.htm&-op=eq&ID_Name=cokely&-find) in the July/August HBR\] that really make me nervous. The first is that you need to work every single day at being great at that one thing if you want to be great. This is true of pitching, painting, parenting, everything. And if you think management in corporate life is an exception, you’re wrong. I mean, the article is in the Harvard Business Review for a reason.

I was trying to come up with responses to these to let them know that it is worth the effort if you've found something you love. I was having a hard time coming up with the right words, so took a break to watch tennis. To watch Roger Federer win the Australian Open, his record 16th major tournament win.

And it all became clear. Not a whole lot of words needed (though I ended up typing a lot anyway).

Is chasing mastery worth the trouble? Your damn right it is.
