I use the [600 page Infinity Journal](http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/Product.asp?Params=Category=322-325|Level=2-3|pageid=2854) as my primary day-to-day wastebook, so I don't have to start a new book very often, maybe once every 12 - 18 months depending on what's going on.  On the other hand, my digital wastebook(s) never run out of "pages" so I could keep using the same one forever.  I've found, though, the just the act of changing is a worthwhile process in and of itself.  Thus, my new digital wastebook.

This new blog actually represents the retirement of my two longstanding personal blogs:  [No Straight Lines](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com), dating from June 2003, started out as a blog about Knowledge Management; and [29 Marbles](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com), dating from March 2005, presented a dad's-eye view of autism.  I've found over the years that my many interests overlap, sometimes significantly and sometimes tangentially.  I keep everything together in a single paper notebook, why not keep it all together in a single blog?

When I start a new notebook, I typically fill up the first few pages with copies of what I think is important enough to carry over from the old book.  I expect that this blog will be no different.  So if you see something you've seen before, please accept it for what it is.  And please excuse the construction mess as I play around with this great WordPress.  (What's the point of starting over if you can't play around with it a bit?!?)
