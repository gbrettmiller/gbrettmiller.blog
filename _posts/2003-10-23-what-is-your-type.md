From [Vol 40, No. 4](http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj40-4.html) of the [IBM Systems Journal](http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/), a special edition dedicated to Knowledge Management, is **[Views of knowledge are human views](http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/404/dueck.html)** by [Gunter Dueck](http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/404/dueckaut.html#dueck). In the essay, he discusses the different types of knowledge and different "types" (in the [Keirseyian](http://www.keirsey.com) sense) of people.  
  
Bottom line, says that when you are working up your KM strategy you need to keep in mind what "type" of people are in your organization. More importantly, probably, is that you have to remember that your organization is likely made up of a bunch of different types of people.  
  
In other words, there is no one-size fits all solution for KM.
