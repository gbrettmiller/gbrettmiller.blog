> 'Oxidation is basically burning,' McGinnis said. 'Chemically, it involves the loss of electrons. A burning match is a clear case of oxidation.' Other examples include an apple slice turning brown or vegetable oils that go rancid, he said.  
>   
> McGinnis' studies have found that autistic children exhibit high levels of cellular oxidation, which exacerbates the disorder's symptoms. To treat this, McGinnis is exploring the intravenous use of important antioxidants such as zinc, magnesium and various vitamins. He said his research has shown some success. 'Some of these kids talk only on the days they get these IV treatments,' McGinnis said.

Just as autism is a spectrum, so are the apparent causes....
