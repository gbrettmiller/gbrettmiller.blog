... the St. Louis County [Special School District](http://www.ssd.k12.mo.us/) is conducting an **Autism / Asperger Resource Fair**:

> Experts from SSD and organizations from around the state will provide guidance and materials on autism and Asperger syndrome. The fair will run from 3:30 to 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 11 at SSD Central Administrative Offices in rooms 60 and 61, 12110 Clayton Road, Town & Country.

I'm not sure exactly what they'll have, but it sounds like it is worth checking out.
