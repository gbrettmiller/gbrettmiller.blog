When the context ofÂ "keep me [in the loop](https://gbrettmiller.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/in-the-loop/)" is between manager and managed, things might be a little different. After all, the whole purpose of a staff is to make sure that a boss has the information, knowledge, and insight they need without being burdened with having to figure it out on their own. In a world of information flow built around the distribution of atoms, it made sense that the staff made the decisions on what the boss should see, based (of course) on what the boss said they wanted to see.

When information flow is based on bits, when working out loud is (can be) the norm, when the boss can see what they want to see when they want to see it instead of waiting for a [meeting](http://gbrettmiller.com/meetings-in-the-age-of-working-out-loud/) or the email with the monstrously huge PowerPoint file, they can keep themselves in the loop.

Working out loud goes both ways; it is just as important for managers and leaders to understand how to work out loud as it is for their employees.
