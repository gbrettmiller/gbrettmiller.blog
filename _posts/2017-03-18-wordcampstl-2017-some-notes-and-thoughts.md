What better excuse to overcome the recent dearth of posts here on the Phrontistery than sharing my notes and thoughts from a WordCamp event. In this case [WordCampSTL 2017](https://2017.stlouis.wordcamp.org/). I had hoped to present a talk this year but wasn't sure if I'd actually be able to make it when the deadline for submissions came around, so I volunteered instead.

Some notes and thoughts from the talks I sat in on, as well as the many great conversations between sessions.
