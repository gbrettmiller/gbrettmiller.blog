On the [May 5, 2004 Fresh Air](http://freshair.npr.org/day_fa.jhtml?display=day&todayDate=05/05/2004), Terry interviewed [Dr. Fred Volkmar](http://www.yale.edu/opa/v32.n14/story7.html) from [Yale Child Study Center](http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/index.html). As the parent of an autistic teenager (age 13) there was a lot I had already heard or figured out for myself, but there was quite a bit of good new info as well.  
  
Terry also spoke with Michael John Carley, who was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome as an adult, not long after his son was diagnosed. I have to admit that when Zeke was first diagnosed and I learned more about the syndrome, one of my first thoughts was, "Boy, I didn't miss it by much. A lot of these things describe me." Good stuff. (BTW, Carley is the executive director of [GRASP \[Global and Regional Asperger Syndrome Partnership\]](http://grasp.org).
