How many times have you heard someone say, "Those who can't do, teach (or coach)"? How many times have you said it, or thought it? I think we all probably have at some point in our lives. Except for those who know early on that what they want to do is teach or coach. They know already that teachers and coaches are valuable for their ability to teach and coach, independent of their ability to "do" what they teach or coach.

Over the weekend I saw the video "What Teachers Make" that tackles this question head on. (Found via [Seth's Blog](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/03/what-teachers-make.html).)

Back in December 2008, [I wrote about](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/do-you-have-a-coach-for-your-team/) Malcolm Gladwell's [Q&A with ESPN](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=merron/081208) during his [Outliers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017922?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0316017922) book tour, in which he had this to say about coaches:

> I always find it incredible that an NFL team will draft a running back in the first round, give him a $10 million signing bonus, and get, maybe, four good years out of him. Suppose you spent $10 million finding and training the equivalent of Mike Leach â€” someone who could create a system so good that it could make even the most mediocre athletes play like stars. You could get 40 years out of him.

Good teachers and coaches are invaluable to our children. And to adults, if we are smart enough to go out and find one.
