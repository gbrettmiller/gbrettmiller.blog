Over the weekend I had the chance - the pleasure - to attend [Wordcamp St. Louis 2012](http://2012.stlouis.wordcamp.org/ "Wordcamp St. Louis | Learn s'more WordPress skills!"). I met some great people, doing incredible things with WordPress, and had a chance to learn and be inspired. Although the whole day was great, three of the talks stand out for me:

**Most generally informative**: Chris Miller ([@iDoNotes](http://twitter.com/idonotes "IDoNotes - Twitter")) gave us the down and dirty on using WordPress as a podcasting/videocasting platform, blasting us with way more information than I thought could be squeezed into the 45 minute session. No doubt he had to leave some stuff out, but it was a comprehensive intro that put those interested on the right path for learning more. Especially if they remember to visit the [resource bundle he put together for us](http://bitly.com/bundles/idonotes/7 "Link bundle for Wordcamp 2012").

**Most specifically useful**: Joshua Ray ([@pdxOllo](https://twitter.com/pdxOllo)) Â and Alex Rodriguez ([@arod2634](https://twitter.com/arod2634)) presented [Best Practices and Admin Customization](http://2012.stlouis.wordcamp.org/session/best-practices-and-admin-customization/ "Best Practices and Admin Customization"), the latter which has been on my mind of late for a current project. Comprehensive coverage and plenty of code examples (I'll post the links later, I seem to have misplaced them). Looking forward to digging in.

**Most inspirational**: Although the WordPress specific parts of Reshma Chamberlin's ([@reshmacc](http://twitter.com/reshmacc)) [talk on design](http://2012.stlouis.wordcamp.org/session/breaking-the-mold-starting-with-clients/ "That's a WordPress site? Wow!") were impressive themselves, what impressed - and inspired - me the most was her and her partner's philosophy of design. And not just design, really, but how to chase your dreams, make a difference, and to do things right. (Sounds so easy, doesn't it.) Check out the [B&C Designers](http://www.bcdesigners.com "We love web and print design (and everything in between)") site to see for yourself. (And thanks, Reshma, for the book recommendation: [Disciplined Dreaming](http://joshlinkner.com/the-book/ "Josh Linkner - The Book") is next up on my shelf!)
