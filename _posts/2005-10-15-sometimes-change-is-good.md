Change. If we are not in control of changes happening to us, change can be a frightening thing. Sometimes, our fears are realized. But sometimes change results in great things. And sometimes, whether we want it or not, ask for it or not, change is just "what the doctor ordered."  
  
Following our recent move to St. Louis, things changed a lot (obviously). In addition to the obvious major changes, we've noticed numerous "minor" changes as we adapt to the new environment. Some of the biggest of these "minor" changes have been the result of the new school environments for our kids.  
  
[Tamar](http://www.postcardsfromla.com/blog/about.html) recently moved as well, in her case from CA to NJ. She has written an [uplifting, yet somewhat tear-jerking, essay](http://www.hiddenlaughter.com/essays/2005/1012.html) about the positive effects of changing schools for her autistic son.
