_This meme crossed my desk on Facebook last weekend, and I thought my response was worth sharing here as well. - - -- --- -----_

Don't take too long to think about it. Fifteen authors (poets included) who've influenced you and that will always stick with you. List the first fifteen you can recall in no more than fifteen minutes.

Where to start...? Let's start with fiction.

When I was in the Army, **[Tom Clancy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTom-Clancy%2Fe%2FB000APF4T2%3Fqid%3D1288970703%26sr%3D1-1&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)**'s books were a big influence. I enjoyed all of his books up to _[Executive Orders](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425158632?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0425158632)_, which is where I think he should have stopped.

I love **[Stephen King](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FStephen-King%2Fe%2FB000AQ0842%3Fqid%3D1288970646%26sr%3D1-1&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)**'s work, though I haven't read much recently. (As you'll see, I read more non-fiction these days.)

I've come to appreciate the work of **[William Gibson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWilliam-Gibson%2Fe%2FB000AP5DM0%3Fqid%3D1288970596%26sr%3D1-1&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)** ([@GreatDismal](http://twitter.com/GreatDismal)), and would have to say that my favorite fiction author these days is **[Neal Stephenson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNeal-Stephenson%2Fe%2FB000APS8L8%3Fqid%3D1288970550%26sr%3D1-2-ent&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)**. (I re-read either _[Cryptonomicon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060512806?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060512806)_ or _[Anathem](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061694940?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0061694940)_ every year.)

On the non-fiction side, in no particular order (except the order in which they came to mind):

**[Douglas Hofstadter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDouglas-R.-Hofstadter%2Fe%2FB000AP5GCM%3Fqid%3D1288969404%26sr%3D1-1&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)** From his first book, the masterpiece _[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465026567?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0465026567)_ to his latest, _[I Am a Strange Loop](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465030793?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0465030793)_, he is the instigator of much of my interest in how our minds work.

**[Steven Pinker](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSteven-Pinker%2Fe%2FB000AQ3GGO%3Fqid%3D1288969476%26sr%3D1-1&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)** Speaking of _[How the Mind Works](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393334775?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393334775)_, Pinker's books have also influenced how I think about and understand why we do the things we do, and how we learn.

**[Daniel Pink](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDaniel-H.-Pink%2Fe%2FB001IXS3PC%3Fqid%3D1288969525%26sr%3D1-1&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)** ([@danielpink](http://twitter.com/danielpink)) His latest _[Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594488843?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594488843)_, and his earlier _[A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594481717?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594481717)_ are outstanding.

**[Seth Godin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSeth-Godin%2Fe%2FB000AP9EH0%3Fqid%3D1288969570%26sr%3D1-1&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)** _[Linchpin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843162?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591843162)_

**[Steven Johnson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSteven-Johnson%2Fe%2FB000APC0M6%3Fqid%3D1288969609%26sr%3D1-2-ent&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)** ([@stevenbjohnson](http://twitter.com/stevenbjohnson)) His latest, _[Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594487715?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594487715)_, is the book I wish I had written. _[Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684868768?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0684868768)_ and _[Everything Bad is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture is Actually Making Us Smarter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594481946?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594481946)_ are required reading if you want to understand how our culture ended up the way it is (and why that isn't really so bad.)

**[E.O. Wilson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEdward-O.-Wilson%2Fe%2FB000AQ4776%3Fqid%3D1288969645%26sr%3D1-1&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)** _[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067976867X?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=067976867X)_, and everything else.

**[Richard Feynman](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRichard-P.-Feynman%2Fe%2FB000AQ47U8%3Fqid%3D1288969688%26sr%3D1-1&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)** Not so much an author as a story teller, but oh what stories he had to tell.

**[Atul Gawande](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAtul-Gawande%2Fe%2FB00458K698%3Fqid%3D1288969732%26sr%3D1-1&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)** ([#atulgawande](http://twitter.com/#!/search/atul%20gawande)) I'm not a doctor, and after reading his books I don't understand why anyone would ever want to be. But he has some great insights on what it means to walk the master's path.

**[George Leonard](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGeorge-Burr-Leonard%2Fe%2FB001H6GO7O%3Fqid%3D1288969772%26sr%3D1-1&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)** Speaking of the master's path, _[Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452267560?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0452267560)_ has a permanent place on the shelf on my desk.

I still only understand about 1/2 of it, but I keep going back to it to learn more and more.

OK, OK, that's 16. So, I got a little carried away....
