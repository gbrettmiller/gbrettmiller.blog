Slowly but surely, I'm building up the resources on [Autism for Parents](http://autismforparents.wordpress.com). The latest additions are the following blogs by parents of autistic children:

- [Autism Vox](http://autismvox.com/) - Kristina Chew's soapbox
- [Hard Won Wisdom](http://hardwonwisdom.blogspot.com/) - R.B.'s blog that was "never around when I needed it"
- [Living a Cryptogram](http://thehoses.blogspot.com/) - Melissa, at the beginning of the journey
- [On the Spectrum](http://onthespectrum.blogspot.com/) - Chris, parent of a 7 year old boy "on the spectrum"
- [The Zoë Zone](http://zoe.bromage.org/notes/) - Notes on the life, times, and development of Miss Zoë Bromage, as recorded by her mother.
