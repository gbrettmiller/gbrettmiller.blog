> The neurodiversity movement has been important for shifting what is meant by “human” rights so that both speaking and non-speaking autistics obtain rights to access - be it a communication device, support for that device and for daily life, education, and community inclusion. **We remember, however, that these methods of inclusion have, so far, been extensions to the neurotypical way of life - an architecture.** We ask, now, how neurodiversity can re-form the architecture itself. What is neurodiversity becoming? How are we becoming with neurodiversity?
