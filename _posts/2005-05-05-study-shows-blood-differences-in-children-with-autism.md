Several stories today about a study that has identified a possible biological basis for autism. Representative of the stories is [Study Shows Blood Differences In Children With Autism](http://www.thekcrachannel.com/health/4456899/detail.html):

> Amaral and his colleagues have just announced the findings of a new study that shows, for the first time on a large scale, a major difference in the blood of children with autism, compared to the blood of typical children. The hope is that there could be a routine blood test that would detect autism at birth.  
>   
> 'What we've discovered is more than 100 proteins that are different in these children. Now, we have to go back and figure out what these proteins do, whether they are simply markers or maybe they are even causative of the disorder,' Amaral said.

I'll see if I can find the actual paper....
