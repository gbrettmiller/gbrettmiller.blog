"If you really need something to get done, find someone who is already busy."

I've heard this advice many times over the years, and even given it as advice a few times. I have accepted it as true, but haven't given much thought to why it is true.

Reading Seth Godin's latest, Linchpin, the answer occurred to me: busy people are the artists, the linchpins of an organization. The ones who actually get things done and make things happen.

On the other hand you have what I would call the "occupied" people, those who perform a specific task that was given them and then wait for someone to tell them their next task. These are the factory workers, the interchangeable pieces of the infrastructure of the company. The people who simply do things.

When I look at it this way, it's obvious why the busy person is who you turn to when you need someone.
