...in this day and age the [number 13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_(number)#As_lucky.2C_unlucky.2C_or_significant_number "wikipedia - 13 (number)") is still so deliberately avoided (at least in the U.S.) in hotels and airplanes? Hotels typically don't have a 13th Floor, yet they do have room numbers with 13 in it (such as 213, 1213, 1413: just no 1313). I have never seen an airplane with a 13th row, but airport terminals do have a Gate 13.

What would happen if all of a sudden hotels and planes had 13th floors and 13th rows? Would they go unsold? If those were the only rooms or seats available, would people choose another hotel / flight?

Hmmmm.
