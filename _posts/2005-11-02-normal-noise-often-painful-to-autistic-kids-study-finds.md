I don't think that any parent of an autistic child (or autistic kids/adults themselves) will be surprised by the findings of this study: Noise, even 'normal' noise, bothers a lot of autistic kids. What I found most interesting about the study results, at least as reported in [this story in the NZ Herald](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10353070), is the grouping of autistic and gifted children together in the study's findings.  
  
The so-what of the findings is expressed very well by Stuart McLaren of Massey University in the wrap up to the story:

> Providing quiet spaces is one way to help autistic and gifted children, and researchers will investigate other strategies.  
>   
> 'Much of the present work is focused on these children being integrated into regular early childhood education environments.  
>   
> 'However, we must look more closely at the learning environment too,' says Mr McLaren.  
>   
> '**Why is it acceptable to expect autistic children to negotiate their way around any such environment when we never expect children with physical disabilities to negotiate their way up a flight of steps?**'
