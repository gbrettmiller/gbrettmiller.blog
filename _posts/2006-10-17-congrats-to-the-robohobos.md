![The Robohobos](images/robohobos1.jpg "The Robohobos")Each fall, middle and high schools from several states gather together for a friendly robotics competition. [BEST (Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology) Robotics](http://www.bestinc.org/MVC/ "BEST Robotics Inc: Middle and High School Robotics Competition") puts on this competition with the goal of increasing student's interest in (you guessed it) engineering, science, and technology. This past Saturday, schools from Missouri and Illinois gathered at St. Louis University for [Billiken BEST](http://www.slu.edu/billikenbest/purpose_billiken_best.html "Billiken BEST - St. Louis University"), the local hub competition. As the father of a member of the Parkway North High School Robotics team, the [Robohobos](http://www.geocities.com/pnh_robotics/ "Welcome to the Homepage of Parkway North High's Robohobos"), I'd like to congratulate them on their [achievements at the event](http://www.slu.edu/billikenbest/2005_gameday.html "Billiken BEST 2006 Game Day results"):

- 3d Place - Founders Award for Creative Design
- 3d Place - Best Web Site Design
- 2d Place - Most Photogenic Robot
- 2d Place - Robotics Game

![The Robohobo's laundry machine](images/laundry_machine_2.jpg "The Robohobo's laundry machine")When you consider that the teams have only 6 weeks from Kick-off Day to Game Day to implement the engineering process, come up with a design, and build and test the robot - and that they do it in their "spare time" outside of school - this is a very impressive achievement.

By placing 2d in the Game, the Robohobos have qualified to compete at the [Frontier Trails](http://www.uafortsmith.edu/FTBEST "Frontier Trails BEST - UA Fort Smith") regional event at the University of Arkansas - Fort Smith in a couple of weeks. I'll let you know how it turns out.
