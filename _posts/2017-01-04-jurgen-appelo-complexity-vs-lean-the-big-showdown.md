> Lean software development promotes removing waste as one of its principles. However, complexity science seems to show that waste can have various functions. **In complex systems things that look like waste can actually be a source for stability and innovation;** Lean software development preaches optimize the whole as a principle, and then translates this to optimization of the value chain. However, I believe that **complexity science shows us a value chain is an example of linear thinking, which usually leads to sub-optimization of the whole organization** because it is a non-linear complex system.  -- [Jurgen Appelo](https://twitter.com/jurgenappelo)

Exactly. Somewhat reflects my own thoughts and is something that has been on my mind quite a bit of late amidst an organization and projects hell bent on removing not just the optimum amount of waste from a process but removing all white space from the environment in pursuit of maximum efficiency toward the achievement of what they already know how to do. (breathe, Brett...)

As I wrote in [KM vs LSS vs CPI](http://gbrettmiller.com/2016/02/04/km-vs-lss-vs-cpi/), too often "improvement" is seen as requiring a single, all or nothing approach. When, in fact, improvement and optimal performance comes from a mix of techniques. Sometimes waste is a hindrance, and sometimes it's where you find the gold.
