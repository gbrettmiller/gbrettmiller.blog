Every year when April - otherwise known as [Autism Awareness Month](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=autism+awareness+month+2011) - rolls around, I ask myself, "Awareness? Awareness of what exactly?" In the past I have often forgotten my own advice and tried to find a "one-size-fits-all" answer to the question. (My advice: there is no such thing as one-size-fits-all for anything.) Some years I just bailed on the question altogether. Like last year, this year I'm going to focus on one aspect - a theme, if you will - of autism awareness.

A consistent theme throughout all the various incarnations of this blog, not to mention my life as the parent of an autistic son, has always been that **parenting is parenting**, no matter what kind of kid(s) you have. It seems fitting that I use that as my theme.

Everyone is different, of course. The challenge with autism is that autistic kids - and their parents - are different in a different way, a way that many people are not familiar with and - more importantly - not comfortable with.

So, for the next month I am going to revisit and repost some old articles and write a few new ones to build on this theme. I will also be looking around the web for others talking about the same theme. If I can make just one person more aware that **parenting is parenting, even for those with autistic kids**, I will consider my efforts a success.

Of course, I'm expecting to reach more people than that.
