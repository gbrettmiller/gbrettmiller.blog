Autism blogger [Lisa Jo Rudy](http://autism.about.com/) once challenged parents to “quit autism for just one day.”

> Your child with autism may always be autistic, but there are places and circumstances in which it either doesn’t matter – or in which your child’s special talents make autism irrelevant. Whether it’s at the beach, in the woods, at a concert, or creating a work of art – just for one day – go somewhere where autism doesn’t matter.
> 
> Just for one day, quit being the parent of a child with autism. And become just a plain, ordinary, loving, proud parent.

Everything I’ve learned about parenting an autistic child can be boiled down to an incredibly simply stated idea (provided to me by a fellow autism dad): **Parenting is parenting**.

My response to Lisa’s challenge reflects this attitude:

> Just one day? Every day should be like that. At the very least, every day should start like that. You can’t always control how a day will end up, but only you can control how your day starts.
> 
> I am the parent of a trampolinist. I am the parent of a horse-back rider (equestrian?) I am the parent of two pianists. I am the parent of two high school students. I am the parent of two avid gamers. I am the parent of an autistic son and an NT son.
> 
> I am, to use your words, “just a plain, ordinary, loving, proud parent."
> 
> Every day.

No doubt parenting an autistic child can be hard. But don't let that turn you into an "autism case manager". Don't let it stop you from being a parent. A plain, ordinary, loving, proud parent.

**Every day.**
