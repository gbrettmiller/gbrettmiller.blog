If parenting is indeed a journey (as I [wrote yesterday](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/9874/)), parenting an autistic child is a detour from the path that a parent's journey normally takes. Several years ago I heard the following (I wish I could remember the source):

> A truly happy person enjoys the scenery on a detour.

Would I have chosen this detour at the beginning of the journey, if I'd been given the option? Probably not. The road has been rough at times and it has taken a little bit longer to get from way point to way point along the path.

But I've seen things, experienced things, that many parents will never even know are possible. I've learned things about myself, about others, and about my kids that I would never have otherwise learned.

I have to say that I've enjoyed the scenery on our detour. I encourage you to try to do the same.
