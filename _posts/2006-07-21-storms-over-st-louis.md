Last night, St. Louis experienced perhaps [the worst storm in its history](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=&ie=UTF-8&q=St.+Louis+storm+July&btnG=Search+News "Google search - St. Louis storm July"). Strong winds blew down trees and buildings, and even knocked 3 tractor-trailer trucks on their sides while crossing the Chain of Rocks bridge across the Mississippi River. An estimated 500,000 people in the St. Louis area are without power.

The storm was so bad, in fact, that it made national news. [Mayor Francis Slay](http://stlouis.missouri.org/citygov/mayor/mayorbio.html "Official Biography - Mayor Francis Slay") was interviewed on [NPR](http://www.npr.org "National Public Radio")'s [All Things Considered](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2 "NPR - All Things Considered"), which I heard this afternoon while driving home. You can hear what he had to say in [St. Louis Crippled by Widespread Blackouts](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5571395 "NPR All Things Considered - St. Louis Crippled by Widespread Blackouts").

I got the following pictures of the lightning show from my front porch (after the sirens had stopped and we came out of the basement, that is!)
