"Hey everyone, I know this doesn't apply to all of you (probably not even most of you), but a couple of people screwed this up and I really don't like telling people directly that they screwed up and please don't do it again, so I'm sending out this email to everyone in the hopes that the people that screwed it up will read this and take notice. If this doesn't apply to you, please disregard, if it does apply to you I sure hope you actually read this and understand that it applies to you."
