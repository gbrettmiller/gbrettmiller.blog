Yesterday morning on [NPR](http://www.npr.org/)'s [Morning Edition](http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3), I heard [Ben Mattlin's commentary](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5042181) Valuing Life Whether Disabled or Not (available in either [Windows Media](http://www.npr.org/dmg/dmg.php?prgCode=ME&showDate=07-Dec-2005&segNum=12&NPRMediaPref=WM&getAd=1) or [Real Player](http://www.npr.org/dmg/dmg.php?prgCode=ME&showDate=07-Dec-2005&segNum=12&NPRMediaPref=RM&getAd=1) format).

> Commentator Ben Mattlin has been quadriplegic since birth. At the memorial service for a disabled friend who passed away, he came to realize the world needs to expand its definition of what it means to live a successful life, disability or not.

What caught my attention, and inspired the first part of the title of this post, were the last few sentences of the commentary:

> Are there no wheelchairs in heaven? I'm not buying it. For me, if there is a heaven, it's not a place where I'll be able to walk. It's a place where it doesn't matter if you can't.

If there is indeed a heaven, and our autistic children go there when they die, will they still be autistic?
