Seth Godin doesn't write about autism, and yet much of what he writes and says comes across as if it were written just for the parents of an autistic child. Today's article - [Accepting limits](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/04/accepting-limits.html) - from his blog is a perfect example (emphasis is mine):

> Isn't it **absurd to focus so much energy on 'practical' skills that prep someone for a life of following instructions** but relentlessly avoid the difficult work necessary to push someone to reinvent themselves into becoming someone who makes a difference?
> 
> And isn't it even **worse to write off a person** or an organization merely because of what they are **instead of what they might become**?

Much of what counts as autism intervention these days focuses on making the child - or the adult - ["more normal" or "less autistic"](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/autism-and-drive/). Â Granted there are things that autistic people need to be taught and understand so they can function in the world, there is no denying that. But this doesn't mean that their uniqueness should be driven out of them in the process.

Don't write off your child's future - or worse, your child - just because they are autistic. There is great potential there, if you are willing to do the work necessary to uncover it.
