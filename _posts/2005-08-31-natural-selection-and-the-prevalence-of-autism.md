I've always been interested in how the brain works and have read quite a bit on the subject of evolutionary psychology and biology and some on cognitive neuroscience. (Once Zeke was diagnosed as hyperlexic and PDD/ASD, I was **really** interested.) Reading through some of many posts on the neurodiversity vs. biomed debate, I've been thinking about the role of natural selection in the recent "explosion" of autism cases.  
  
I figured before I wrote anything I should do a little research, lit review, etc. In my Google search, I came across [Origins of Autism](http://originsofautism.com/) from 2003 and an earlier paper, [Human Evolution: Evolution and the Structure of Health and Disease](http://serpentfd.org/), from 1998. It's late and I've not had a chance to read through either of these in any detail, but they definitely look like they are worth reading.  
  
I'm anxious to find out what their conclusions are.
