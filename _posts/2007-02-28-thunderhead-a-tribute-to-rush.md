I've been a fan of the Canadian rock trio [Rush](http://www.rush.com "Rush - The official band website") for many years, since high school, so when my brother called me up a couple of weeks ago and asked if I wanted to go check out a local Rush tribute band I immediately agreed. I'm glad I did.

![Thunderhead logo](images/home_top.jpg "Thunderhead logo")The band, [Thunderhead](http://www.thunderheadrush.com "Thunderhead"), played at the [House of Rock](http://www.stlhouseofrock.com/ "HOUSE OF ROCK: St. Louis' Premier Rock Club") in South (St. Louis) County on a Friday night (9 Feb). We got there early to make sure we had a place to sit (and set down our beers!), and good thing. As show time approached the place filled up quickly.

Like Rush, Thunderhead is a three-man band: George Whitlow on bass, keyboards, and vocals, Corey Nelson on guitars, and Mike Ramsey on percussion (you can't simply call it "drums" when you are talking about Rush!). And I have to say, these guys ROCKED. (Well worth the 5 buck cover.)

I wasn't really sure what to expect from the show, as I had never seen a "tribute band" perform. I had in mind the "cover bands" that travel the club circuit, playing a collection of covers from various bands, genres, etc. The music is usually good, but very rarely do the bands seem to make a whole-hearted effort to re-create the sound of the original. (Not saying that's bad, I love a good cover band.)

A 'tribute band,' on the other hand, has as its goal a faithful reproduction of most, if not all, aspects of a bands music and performance. In that, [Thunderhead](http://www.myspace.com/thunderheadrush "MySpace - Thunderhead") succeeded.

One of the things that became immediately obvious when they started playing was that this wasn't just a bunch of guys that got together on the weekends to play some music. I can only imagine how much time they put into 1) learning the music as individuals, 2) learning the songs as a group, 3) staging the performance (lights, sound, etc), and 4) rehearsal of the whole package.

With the exception of some vocal problems George had (a cold exacerbated, no doubt, by the thick smoke in the club), their performance was right on. As much as I've always enjoyed Neil Peart's lyrics, it is Rush's musicality that I most love. The extended guitar solos in songs, the mandatory (and brilliantly executed) drum solo, and the group jams that are Rush's instrumentals were great. My personal favorite - the jazzy, funky, and rocking _La Villa Strangiato_.

If you live in the St. Louis area, keep an eye on their [tour page for upcoming dates](http://www.thunderheadrush.com/tour.html "Thunderhead - Tour dates"). If you are a fan of Rush, you owe it to yourself to check these guys out.
