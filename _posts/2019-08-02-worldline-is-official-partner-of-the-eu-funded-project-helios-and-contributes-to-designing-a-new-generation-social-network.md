> HELIOS is a 3-year Research and Innovation Action project funded by the European Commission as part of its H2020 Programme, working on the development of a decentralised social media platform that will address the dynamic nature of human communication and interactions, and create a setting that provides the users control of three aspects: privacy, ownership, and sharing of content â€“ all of which are stripped away when using any of the mainstream platforms.
