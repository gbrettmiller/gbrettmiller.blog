> Service design is no longer new or unknown. The practice is maturing as service design firms gain experience and organisations start to bring service design in house. Journey maps are all the rage, and everyone is talking about designing for the end to end customer experience. So what does it take to be a great service designer? How is it different from other design disciplines? What is the craft of service design? How might you build service design into your team? This talk will tackle these question and provide a foundation for exploring service design further.
