[Tony Karrer's comments](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2008/lessons-learned-and-learned-lessons#comment-52697) to a [recent post of mine](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2008/lessons-learned-and-learned-lessons) that discussed the application of a craft work model to knowledge work got me thinking a bit more about the subject. I've also been thinking some about the one of the goals of the Work Literacy project, specifically to "help build a foundation of knowledge of methods for knowledge work" (as Tony wrote in comments to Michele's post [Knowledge Workers as Craft Workers](http://www.workliteracy.com/knowledge-workers-as-craft-workers#respond)).

So instead of apprentice/journeyman/master, which refer as much to an individual's position within an organization as it does to the individual's skill level, I'm thinking the more basic terms of competency, literacy, and mastery may apply. These speak directly to the skill level of the individual in terms of the individual's goals, and is independent of any organization they may be part of.

Obviously, these terms will need to be defined a bit in the context of knowledge work and work literacy to be of use to the current effort. A good place to start is at the basic definitions of the terms:

- [Competent](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/competent): having suitable or sufficient skill, knowledge, experience, etc., for some purpose; properly qualified; adequate but not exceptional.
- [Literate](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Literate): having knowledge or skill in a specified field
- [Mastery](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Mastery): command or grasp, as of a subject:

Though competency and literacy seem to be very similar, I see them as distinct in the following way. Competence means that you have the knowledge/skill to perform a given task, without necessarily understanding why it is done or having the ability to adapt of if the conditions under which you learned the skill change. Literacy, on the other hand, suggests that you understand why you perform the task the way it is and that you have the ability to adapt your performance to changing conditions and still be successful.

To re-word Tony's goal stated above, the question in my mind then becomes, "What competencies are needed for knowledge workers today?"

Here are a couple that come to mind. I'll save more detailed discussion of these for the comments or future posts.

SUGGESTED COMPETENCIES

- Technology (hardware)
- Technology (software)
- Personal Computers
- Social Networking (technical and personal)
- [Visual Communications](http://www.workliteracy.com/is-the-ability-to-create-visuals-an-important-work-literacy)
- Information Assurance / Security
- Impact of Globalization
- Finance / money
- Interpersonal communications

I'm sure there are more, and I'm sure some of these may not be appropriate. But it is a start.
