Frequent readers of this blog know that in my attempt to understand autism better, I have a tendency to see connections in things that aren't always directly related to autism.  A lot of times this will come in the form of a song, a TV show, or a main- or sub-theme in a movie (like the [X-Men trilogy](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2006/04/more-thoughts-on-autism-inspired-by-the-x-men-film-trilogy/)).

My post yesterday brought to mind [Bruce Hornsby](http://www.brucehornsby.com/)'s (excellent) song, The Way It Is (from the [album of the same name](http://www.brucehornsby.com/album_the_way_it_is.htm)).

> They say, "Hey little boy you can't go Where the others go 'Cause you don't look like they do" Said, "Hey old man How can you stand to think that way Did you really think about it Before you made the rules" He said, son
> 
> That's just the way it is Some things will never change That's just the way it is Ah, but don't you believe them

"Don't you believe them."  Don't listen when someone tells you that you can't change things, that this is how it was meant to be.  Nothing is "meant to be", that is the wonder of being human, that we determine what is for ourselves.

> Well they passed a law in '64 To give those who ain't got a little more But it only goes so far Because the law don't change in another's mind When all it sees AT the hiring time Is the line on the color bar
> 
> That's just the way it is Some things will never change That's just the way it is That's just the way it is, it is, it is, it is

Note that in the chorus after the last verse, Hornsby never says "don't you believe them".  I don't know if this was intentional or not, but it is definitely true.  You can make a law, you can tell people what they have to do, but you can't tell them how to think about others.  That takes education, persistence, and persuasion.

And that, I believe, is the challenge we all face in gaining more understanding and acceptance for autistics, indeed for all people who are different.
