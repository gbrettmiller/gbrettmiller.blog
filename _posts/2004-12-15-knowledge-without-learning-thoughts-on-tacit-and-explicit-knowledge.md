Can you really **know** something if you didn't **learn** it?  
  
I was sitting in a meeting the other day in which a group of engineers was giving a presentation on some analysis of a system they are working on. The slides were well done and had a lot of "information" on them. As I was looking at the slides later, I realized that I could easily digest and retain the **explicit** knowledge that the slides represented, but that I had absolutely no idea of the [**tacit** knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge) that was created by the engineers in the process of preparing this presentation.  
  
I've long considered explicit knowledge to be not much more than **information** (at least from an individual perspective). The content of these slides is, to me, information that I can use to further develop my own knowledge of the content. If you were to ask me a question about the system, I could tell you the information that was on the slides. I might, if I had good notes and recall that day, be able to tell you a little bit about how the information was derived.  
  
I would "know" the information, but would I really know anything "about" the information?  
  
Some similar thoughts from Frank Patrick in [It's More Than the Numbers](http://www.focusedperformance.com/2004_12_01_blarch.html#10876551351590285):

> It's the logical analysis of situations -- the understanding of cause-and-effect that results in what the numbers are saying -- that lead to "improved business decisions." ... What helps round out the sufficiency is the application of logical analysis to provide a context for the quantitative analysis. You can't run a business "by the numbers" alone.

_Update:_  
  
Saw [Practical Wisdom](http://denham.typepad.com/km/2004/12/practical_wisdo.html) this morning. Denham discusses the new book [**Deep Smarts**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591395283/gbrettmiller-20) in which the authors "explore the cognitive and competency practices that enable swift decisions, explain master level experience and examine ways to transfer these exceptional skills."
