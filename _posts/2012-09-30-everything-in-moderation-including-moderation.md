One of the most common pieces of advice many people hear is something along the lines of, "Everything in moderation."  Of course, this advice usually comes in response to over indulgence in something that the advice giver thinks is bad for you.

"Beer is fine, but in moderation."

"It's OK to watch TV / play video games / whatever, just do it in moderation."

While this makes some sense at first glance,  moderation in everything is a sure path to mediocrity. Unless, of course, moderation itself is practiced in moderation. Passionate pursuit of anything is, almost by definition, not moderate.

So, instead of "everything" in moderation, pursue in moderation only those things that do not help you achieve your purpose, your passion. We all need to take a break at times, to let off steam or to just veg (or geek) out.

To those things that are your passion, your purpose, devote as much time and energy as you can. Passion is no place for moderation.
