One of my favorite [Pink Floyd](http://www.pinkfloyd.com/) songs is Brain Damage from the classic [Dark Side of the Moon](http://www.pinkfloyd.com/dsotm/content/setup.html).  Roger Waters says he wrote it in response to the pressure he felt as a teenager to fit in, to not be so different.

\= = == === =====

The lunatic is on the grass. The lunatic is on the grass. Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs. **Got to keep the loonies on the path.**

The lunatic is in the hall. The lunatics are in my hall. The paper holds their folded faces to the floor And every day the paper boy brings more.

And if the dam breaks open many years too soon And if there is no room upon the hill And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

The lunatic is in my head. The lunatic is in my head You raise the blade, you make the change You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane. You lock the door And throw away the key **There's someone in my head but it's not me.**

As parents we have a responsibility to our children to help shape who they are, but more importantly to help them figure out who they are.   Autistic or not, we are who we are.
