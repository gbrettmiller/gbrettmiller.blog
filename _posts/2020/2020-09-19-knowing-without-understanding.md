A while back, I asked (and sought to answer) the question, "[Can you **know** something if you didn't **learn** it](https://gbrettmiller.blog/2004/12/14/knowledge-without-learning-thoughts-on-tacit-and-explicit-knowledge/)?" The question I was pondering today is, "Can you know something, and apply that knowledge, without understanding it?"

The short answer, I believe, is yes. Need to give some more thought to the long answer.
