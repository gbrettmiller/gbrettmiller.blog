I like movies. I watch them a lot. Probably too much. Though I of course prefer good movies, "good" is a randomly moving target sometimes. I have been known to get sucked into what turns out to be just an awful movie, but still get something out of it.Â This comes in large part from my interest in the overall process of making a film, my appreciation of a movie beyond just the story.

To me, watching a movie and only seeing/hearing the story is like looking at the Mona Lisa and just seeing a portrait of a woman. It's not just "a" work of art that appeals to me, it is from an appreciation of "the work" of art that I derive pleasure. Everything that went into it.

You probably won't be surprised that I often enjoy the "making of" documentaries (audio, visual, written) as much, or even more, than the actual thing being made. And this isn't limited to just movies. I love it when bands include mini-documentaries with CD releases, and interviews or talks by authors about how they developed the ideas and narratives of books simply fascinates me.

It's hard to overstate how much I've learned from them.
