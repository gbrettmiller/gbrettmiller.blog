The second meeting of the STLX Service Design Book Club where we dig into the details of Part One of [Majid Iqbal](https://twitter.com/mxiqbal)'s [_Thinking In Services_](https://designcoders.org/book/).

_Note: the recording starts about 10 minutes into the conversation because someone (me!) forgot to start it earlier :)_

_Note 2: This is a non-HD video._
