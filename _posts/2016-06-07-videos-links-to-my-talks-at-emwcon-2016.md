I presented the following at [Enterprise MediaWiki Conference (EMWCon) 2016](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/EMWCon_Spring_2016) on 25 - 26 May. This talk, along with all of the other talks from the conference, are [available on Livestream](http://livestream.com/internetsociety/emwcon/) courtesy of the [Internet Society](http://www.internetsociety.org).

_Note: Unfortunately I am unable to embed the videos here, I can't find a WordPress shortcode for Livestream videos and am unable to install the Embedly plugin. Will keep looking for options._
