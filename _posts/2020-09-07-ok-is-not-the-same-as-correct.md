Have you ever noticed, when you pay with a credit/debit card just about anywhere, after the questions to enter your PIN, do you want cash back, etc., the machine asks you a question along the lines of, "$99.99, is this OK?"

Well, chances are it's not OK. But chances are very good that it is **correct****.** 

This is one of those things that I've noticed, and sometimes commented on (to the obvious pain of the cashier, "No, it's not OK"), for a while. But it wasn't until I saw one recently that actually said, "$99.99, is this correct?" that I really noticed it.

And wondered why the rest of them don't do it that way, too.
