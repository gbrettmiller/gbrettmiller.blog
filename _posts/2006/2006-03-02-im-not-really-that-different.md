I know the [story of Jason McElwain](http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--hoopshero0228feb28,0,725754.story?coll=ny-region-apnewyork) has been around the world and back again by now, but I couldn't help but print this quote from him:

> 'I'm not really that different,' he said. 'I don't really care about this autistic situation, really. It's just the way I am. The advice I'd give to autistic people is just keep working, just keep dreaming, you'll get your chance and you'll do it.'

Good advice for anyone, autistic or not.
