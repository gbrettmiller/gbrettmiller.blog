From the article [Web site debuts to help disabled make transition](http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060202/NEWS/602020360/-1/NEWS01):

> While in public school, students with disabilities have individual education plans designed by parents, their class- room teachers and professional teams that include a psychologist. The plan is renewed annually, and the final plan is supposed to include a transition plan.  
>   
> But the shift after school still is a jolt to many....  
>   
> '... the reality is, you have to take the initiative,' Lund said. 'You have to understand it on your own. This \[Web site\] will be one more tool.'

I've emphasized what I think is the key point here: There are plenty of people and organizations out there that will help you plan the transition, but no one is going to do it for you.  
  
It's never too early.
