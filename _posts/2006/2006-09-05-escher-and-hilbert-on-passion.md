From my [M. C. Escher](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/m._c._escher "M. C. Escher - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") calendar:

> Any schoolboy with a little aptitude can perhaps draw better than I; but what he lacks in most cases is that tenacious desire to make it reality, that obstinate gnashing of the teeth and saying, "Although I know it can't be done, I want to do it anyway."

This brings to mind a passage from [John Derbyshire](http://olimu.com/ "John Derbyshire's Home Page")'s book [Prime Obsession](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0452285259&tag=gbrettmiller-20&camp=1789&creative=9325 "Prime Obsession - amazon.com"), a combined biography of [Bernhard Riemann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann "Bernhard Riemann - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") and history of attempts to solve his famous [hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis "Riemann hypothesis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"):

> \[David\] [Hilbert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert "David Hilbert - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") believed firmly in the unbounded power of the human mind to uncover the truths of Nature and mathematics. In his youth, the rather pessimistic theories of the French philosopher [Emil du Bois-Reymond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_du_Bois-Reymond "Emil du Bois-Reymond - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") had been very popular. Du Bois-Reymond maintained that certain things - the nature of matter and of human consciousness, for example - are intrinsically unknowable. He coined the apothegm _ignoramus et ignorabimus_ - "we are ignorant and we shall remain ignorant." Hilbert had never liked this gloomy philosophy. ...

> > We ought not believe those who today, with a philosophical air and a tone of superiority, prophesy the decline of culture, and are smug in their acceptance of the _Ignorabimus_ principle. For us there is no _Ignorabimus_, and in my opinion there is none for the natural sciences either. In place of this foolish _Ignorabimus_, let our resolution be, to the contrary: "We must know, we shall know."

As I've mentioned before, desire and passion (and a touch of obsession) are key to achieving mastery, and accomplishing things that no one else thinks is even possible.
