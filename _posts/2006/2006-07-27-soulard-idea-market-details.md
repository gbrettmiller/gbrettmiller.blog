Catching up on blogs and e-mail, I saw that [Matt Homann](http://thenonbillablehour.typepad.com/nonbillable_hour/ "the [non]billable hour") has posted details on the upcoming meeting of the [Soulard Idea Market](http://thenonbillablehour.typepad.com/nonbillable_hour/2006/07/soulard_idea_ma_1.html "Soulard Idea Market Details") on 8 August here in St. Louis. It looks to be an enjoyable, and very interesting evening with the following on the 'agenda':

- Initial Brainstorming
- Idea Speed Dating (the one I'm most looking forward too)
- Open Space Problem Solving
- Open Space Idea Sharing
- Unreasonable Request Time (which promises to be on of the more interesting parts of the evening, if only because it is new and different from the norm)
- Cocktails

Of course, if this is anything like [BlawgThink](http://www.blawgthink.com "BlawgThink 2005") last October, the 'agenda' will serve merely as a guide, with the group determining where we actually end up.
