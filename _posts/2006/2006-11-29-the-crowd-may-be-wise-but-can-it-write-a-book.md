Tonight's All Things Considered on NPR featured the story [Using the Wiki Method to Write a Book](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6545252 "NPR:  Using the Wiki Method to Write a Book") about the [We Are Smarter than Me](http://wearesmarter.org/ "We Are Smarter Than We : Home") project.

> The project was inspired, in part, by the open-source software movement and by the success of [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org "Wikipedia"), the free online encyclopedia, which is largely written and edited by its users. The promoters of _We Are Smarter Than Me_ are hoping that they, too, can harness the online community and produce a book about how to do that in business.
> 
> The creators have outlined proposed chapter headings and written the first one or two pages of each, including case studies that can be used as jumping-off points. One chapter, for example, focuses on how to manage a company when functions such as creating and marketing the product are handled by the community. How should the firm organize itself? What would the management structure look like?

I signed up, if only to be able to track the progress. It's hard to say if I'll have anything I feel is worth contributing. (Of course, that limitation may not stop some from contributing anyway.) At the time I registered, there were 1805 registered 'authors', including 79 others today. I expect that the NPR story will help build membership a bit.

A quick scan of the discussion forums (fora?) showed a lively discussion, a lot of folks just trying to figure out how to use this not-so-new capability of a wiki in a new way. More importantly, there was some discussion and concern that the project doesn't turn into a situation where the new tool (the wiki) is used to implement an old process (writing a book), instead of the new tool helping to change the way a book can be written.

It will be interesting to see if the [Wisdom of Crowds](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/0385503865/002-5407170-8100056 "Amazon - Wisdom of Crowds") comes out.
