Clicking through links on the Autism Bloggers Ring (see the bottom of this page for the links), I found myself at [Our Aspergers Teenage Boy](http://aspergerteen.blogspot.com). In a [recent post](http://aspergerteen.blogspot.com/2006/01/mom-reports-tommy-is-getting-smart.html), Mom reports:

> Tommy is getting smart-mouthy. This is normal teenager stuff that gets treated differently because of his Aspergers. He is also starting to fight doing schoolwork.

I've written a bit before about how it is hard to tell sometimes whether things that come up are because of Z's autism or because he is a teenager. Mom's post above, expecially the bolded part (my emphasis, btw) got me thinking:  
  
We expect our NT kids to "act out" and rebel at some point, because it is 'normal', but seem to try to stop our autistic/Aspie teenagers from "acting out" because we want them to _be_ 'normal.'  
  
Just seems kind of odd. Definitely a delicate balancing act we parents (all of us) have to perform.
