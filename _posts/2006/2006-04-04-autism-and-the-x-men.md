I was kind of paying attention to the TV this weekend when the trailer for [X-Men III: The Last Stand](http://www.x-menthelaststand.com/) came on. I really started paying attention when the character of Storm said:

> There's nothing to cure! This is who we are.

If you're not familiar with the X-Men series of movies - or the Marvel comic books on which the films are based - the basic story is of a group of 'mutants' and their struggle to gain acceptance by non-mutants, aka humans.  
  
The basic premise of this third of three movies is that the government (humans) have found a "cure" for mutant-ism and is trying to force mutants to be 'cured.' As you can probably tell from the quote above, the mutants don't want to - DON'T THINK THEY NEED TO BE - cured.  
  
(Sound familiar yet?)
