Thanks to Hobie Swan over at the [Mindjet blog](http://blog.mindjet.com "The Mindjet Blog") for a [heads up](http://blog.mindjet.com/2006/09/cnn-to-air-program-that-looks-at-mind-mapping "Hobie Swan - CNN Looks at mind mapping") on the upcoming program [The Quest for genius](http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/08/quest.genius/index.html) to be broadcast on CNN the weekend of 23-24 September. In addition to interviewing [Tony Buzan](http://www.buzan.com.au/buzan_centre/tony_buzan.html "Buzan Centre Australia - About Tony Buzan") and putting mind mapping to the test, host [Richard Quest](http://edition.cnn.com/CNN/anchors_reporters/quest.richard.html "CNN - Richard Quest") will interview chess legend Gary Kasparov, Dr. James Watson (of DNA double-helix fame), and Kim Peek (the real-life inspiration for the "Rain Man").

The show will air Saturday at 06:00, 14:00, 19:00 and Sunday 06:00, 19:00 (all times GMT). Just in case I forget, I've already set up the DVR.
