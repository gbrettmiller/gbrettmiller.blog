> Negative feedback...is a way of reaching an equilibrium point despite unpredictable and changing external conditions.

  
The above quote is from **[Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/068486875X/gbrettmiller-20)** by Steve Johnson, who goes on to say that negative feedback is a way of indirectly pushing a fluid, changeable system toward a goal.  
  
Though not the context in the book, this definition and description of negative feedback is also an excellent definition of **training** (and, for that matter, **learning**). For what is training if not the process of getting to a point you want to be at based on continued refinement of what you are doing?
