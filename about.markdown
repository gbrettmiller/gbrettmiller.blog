> _Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end. -- Semisonic (and also Seneca)_

Hey, there, thanks for stopping by. I'm [gBRETT](https://gbrettmiller.me) (the "g" is silent) and this is an archive of the first twenty years of my adventures in blogging. 

I started blogging back in the [summer of 2003]({% post_url 2003-06-07-organizational-knowledge %}) as I was exploring and learning about knowledge management, with a desire to share what I was learning and to connect with others of like mind. Over time that expanded to include complexity, Enterprise 2.0, working out loud, a whole bunch of things. I eventually created another blog to share my experiences as a parent, especially as father to an autistic son, and to connect and learn from others. Then combined them. (There is a much longer story to all this, but you don't really want to hear it.)  

Believe it or not, before social media, blogs were how people connected, shared, and learned from each other. And how we just wrote. How we thought out loud, even if no one was listening. Truth be told, I miss that. 

But the past is the past, and my wonderings are taking me to new places.

These days I'm on a learning binge of service design, customer experience, journey management, and - yes - generative AI and large language models (LLM). Not to mention my regular wonderings about life, the universe, and everything more generally and how we can make the world a better place for the humans who inhabit it.  

I'm putting the final touches on my new beginnings, where I will once again be wondering out loud. This archive holds my "past", which I hope will continue to be of interest and of value. To both you and me.
