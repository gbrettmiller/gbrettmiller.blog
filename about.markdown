Hey, there, thanks for stopping by. I'm [gBRETT](https://gbrettmiller.me) (the "g" is silent) and this is my blog.

Throughout a career spanning a variety of domains, I have shifted as needed from being a generalist, crossing organizational and functional boundaries to see how everything fits together, to being a specialist, working deep in the self-contained silos that make up the parts of the whole. The context of my work determines the extent to which I generalize or specialize.

I am naturally drawn to the big picture - the "why" and the "so what" and the "how might we" - and at the same time driven to develop a deep understanding of the specializations required to achieve the desired big picture outcomes. My favorite projects are the ones in which I start out having no idea how I will complete them or how they will actually turn out and for which which I am, in a traditional sense, generally unprepared to tackle.

Those are the types of things you can generally expect to find here. Subscribe [via RSS](/feed.xml) to receive updates when I post something new.
